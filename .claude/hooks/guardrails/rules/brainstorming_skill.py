"""Guardrail: redirect upstream brainstorming to TBD's vendored skill.

TBD vendors an adapted copy of superpowers' brainstorming skill at
`.claude/skills/tbd-brainstorming/`. The adaptations are load-bearing: it writes
specs to `docs/specs/`, carries TBD's "required unless it is a bug fix or a minor
UI change" scope and the "a human answers the questions" rule, and does not hand
off to a skill whose own file would trip this repo's plans-guard. Running the
upstream skill instead silently loses all of that.

Unlike inferring *whether* a brainstorm happened — which no hook can see — this
is a string comparison, so it is safe to deny rather than merely inform: the
correct action is unambiguous and the agent can immediately re-invoke.
