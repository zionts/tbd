# The child is a party to the transport contract

## Summary

The pty-holder transport
([`2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md`](2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md))
has a complete theory of one boundary and none of the other two. The boundary
it theorizes is **who reads the pty master**: exactly one reader, arbitrated by
the daemon, transferred on an acknowledged edge, failing toward reading nothing.
That theory is rigorous, instrumented, and it holds — a fleet of holder-backed
agent sessions ran through a day of ordinary daemon and app restarts with zero
double-reader incidents, which is the strongest evidence a design can get for
an invariant that is silent when violated.

The two boundaries it does not theorize are the ones every silent failure
crossed:

- **Transport → child.** Every acknowledgement on the input path terminates at
  *accepted by the kernel's input queue* — `PTYWrite.Outcome`
  (`Sources/TBDApp/Terminal/PTYWrite.swift:36-43`), the outbox contract in
  [`2026-09-04-pty-write-completion-design.md`](2026-09-04-pty-write-completion-design.md),
  the actuation row's `dispatched`. Nothing asks whether the child consumed the
  bytes, in what mode it interpreted them, or whether it acted.
- **Emulator → consumer.** Every machine read terminates at *rendered from an
  emulator grid*. Nothing says which of the two stores answered, how stale it
  is, or whether the text is faithful.

tmux carried both boundaries implicitly. It tracked each pane's modes, so a
paste was bracketed exactly when the program had asked for bracketing; it owned
a key table, so `Enter` was a key rather than a byte that might land inside a
burst; and `capture-pane` returned spaces for cells nobody wrote. The holder
replaced tmux without replacing any of that, and the specs that followed each
name the consequences as out of scope
([`2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md`](2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md),
"What this does not solve"). The defects that surfaced in the field are the
predicted ones.

This design makes the child a party to the contract, in two halves that are
each useful alone and complete only together:

- **A typed screen contract** replaces `terminal.output`'s bare string. The
  same object that tells a machine reader what is on screen tells the input
  path what modes the child is in — so it closes the read gap and the two
  input gaps (a submitting Enter absorbed by a paste heuristic; named keys
  refused) with one type.
- **Delivery verification on holder sends**, armed by default for the daemon's
  own supervision rails. The verifier reads the transcript, not a pane, and is
  therefore transport-independent by construction; the refusal that keeps it
  off the holder transport rests on a misdescription of what it reads.

The two halves are the two directions of one claim. The mode oracle makes the
daemon's *composition* correct for the child it is typing into; verification
*observes* whether the child acted. Either alone leaves a silent class open:
an oracle without verification fixes the two shapes that are known and says
nothing about the next one, while verification without the oracle makes every
stall loud and leaves every stall a stall.

**Both halves land before the holder `write` verb.** That sequencing is the
one constraint this design places on work already specified. Single-typist
moves the injection writer into the holder — the one process that never
reads the master and so knows nothing about modes
(`Sources/TBDHolder/Holder.swift:9-13`). Shipping the verb first would give
every injection a faster path to the same stall; shipping the oracle first
means the verb inherits finished bytes from a composition step that already
knows what the child is in. See "Sequencing against single-typist" below.

## The evidence

Field measurements on one machine running a live fleet, all on the holder
transport with `pty_holder_enabled` on. They are evidence for the theory above,
not a work list; each has its own fix and owner.

- **Four stalled agent sessions in one day**, each presenting the same way — a
  busy-looking screen, no progress, 0% CPU. One sat for hours on a brief that
  had arrived truncated; neither side could tell. The transport's record for
  every one of them reads `dispatched`.
- **`--text --submit` loses its Enter at ~230 bytes**, as well as at 4 KB. It
  is not a size effect. `performHolderSend` composes envelope, newline, body
  and `\r` as one write
  (`Sources/TBDDaemon/Server/RPCRouter+TerminalHandlers.swift:3222-3233`),
  deliberately, so a message never straddles a routing decision. The tmux arm
  pastes the body inside an *explicit* bracketed paste and presses Enter as a
  second act (`:3112-3126`). On the holder the `\r` arrives in the same read
  as a multi-line chunk, and an agent TUI's paste-burst heuristic keys on the
  *shape* of a chunk, not its byte count — the envelope's newline is enough. A
  bare `?` with `--submit` is two bytes and submits. The handler's own comment
  predicted this outcome for "a very large `--text --submit`" (`:3190-3196`) and
  named the fix: exposing the child's bracketed-paste mode.
- **`--keys` is refused outright** (`:2848-2852`). A key table needs the
  child's cursor-key mode to choose `ESC[A` over `ESCOA`; SwiftTerm tracks it
  (`applicationCursor`, `bracketedPasteMode`, `isCurrentBufferAlternate` in
  `.build/checkouts/SwiftTerm/Sources/SwiftTerm/Terminal.swift:509-588`), but
  only inside whichever emulator is currently reading.
- **1,595 `U+0000` cells across five of nine sessions** in one `terminal.output`
  sweep: a differential painter positions past cells it is not changing, and
  the render projected those cells literally. Fixed in the render
  (`Sources/TBDDaemon/Holder/HolderReader.swift:1255-1285` now projects a
  never-written cell as a space), and no consumer had noticed, because every
  consumer matches on text and a NUL displays as nothing.
- **A machine read of any session a person has open returns an error that
  says the session is gone.** `holderTerminalOutput` (`:1911-1936` in the
  handlers file) requires `reader(for:)`; the attach acknowledgement stops that
  reader (`Sources/TBDDaemon/Holder/HolderRegistry.swift:1396-1431`), and a
  released slot answers nil (`:426-429`). The transport spec's answer — pull a
  snapshot from the app (`2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md:531-538`)
  — is not built: `SidecarFrameType` has five cases and none is a snapshot
  request (`Sources/TBDShared/SidecarFraming.swift:26-32`).

What was instrumented held. The double-reader counter
(`HolderRegistry.swift:297-306`, `:878`) never exceeded one. The faults were
all at the two boundaries with no counter.

## The screen contract

### Shape

`terminal.output` answers with a typed screen rather than a string. The
`TerminalOutputResult` in
`Sources/TBDShared/RPCProtocol.swift:3808-3811` is a single `output: String`,
and a string cannot carry the two facts the transport spec's own failure
policy requires it to carry — which store answered, and that the answer is
stale (`2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md:548-553`).

- **`lines: [String]`** – the requested tail of scrollback plus viewport, one
  entry per row, right-trimmed, trailing blank rows dropped. **Whitelisted:**
  every character is printable or a tab; a never-written cell is a space; the
  trailing half of a wide glyph is omitted. The whitelist is enforced by the
  type's construction, not by each render site remembering to — a row that
  would contain a control character is a bug in the projection, and the
  constructor refuses it rather than shipping it.
- **`viewportStart: Int`** – the index in `lines` of the viewport's first
  row. Everything before it is scrollback. Carried explicitly because it
  cannot be derived: trailing blank rows are dropped, so `lines.count` is not
  `scrollback + size.rows`, and a consumer that subtracted would land in the
  wrong row.
- **`cursor: (row, column)`** – in viewport coordinates, so `lines[viewportStart
  + cursor.row]` is the cursor's line when that row survived trimming; plus
  whether the cursor is visible. The login driver and the pending-input rail
  both reason about where the cursor sits.
- **`size: (columns, rows)`** – the grid the lines were rendered from. A
  consumer that compares against the pty's own size can see a grid that
  disagrees with the child.
- **`modes`** – the child-facing state a writer needs before composing input:
  `bracketedPaste`, `applicationCursor`, `alternateScreen`. Read from the
  emulator that produced the lines, so lines and modes are one observation.
- **`modesObserved`** – whether the answering emulator has witnessed the
  child's mode setup, so a reader can tell an observation from a default. It
  is true one way: the emulator was born with the child at spawn, so the
  startup `DECSET`s waiting in the pty buffer for the first reader landed in
  it. It is false one way, and for that emulator's whole life: an emulator
  built over an already-running child, which is the daemon re-adopting a
  session it did not spawn. A handback preamble restores the modes' *values*,
  since the snapshot states each mode it carries — set or reset — as an escape
  of its own; it raises no provenance, because the store that captured it was
  itself seeded by this emulator's attach preamble and can hand back no more
  than the daemon gave it. Every preamble in the transport originates from a
  daemon emulator's snapshot, so none can carry provenance the reader lacked.
  The field is orthogonal to `source`, which answers a different question —
  which store, and is its screen live — and a re-adopted draining reader is
  honestly `daemon` with `modesObserved: false`, its lines live and its modes
  unobserved.
- **`contentObserved`** – whether the answering emulator has witnessed
  everything the child has painted, so a reader can tell a screen the child
  wrote from a grid that was blank when the emulator inherited it. It comes
  from the same construction fact as `modesObserved` and is true and false in
  the same two cases: true for an emulator born with the child at spawn, which
  has parsed every byte the child has ever written; false, for that emulator's
  whole life, for one built over an already-running child. A handback preamble
  restores the cells' *values*, since the snapshot repaints the screen the
  departing viewer held; it raises no provenance, because that viewer's
  emulator was seeded by this one's attach snapshot. It is a second field
  rather than a second reading of `modesObserved` because the two can diverge
  in principle — a full repaint provoked from outside would restore every cell
  and not one mode — and because they are what different consumers ask about:
  the input path asks whether the modes are facts, and the pending-input rail
  asks whether the cells are. It is orthogonal to `source` in the same way
  `modesObserved` is: a re-adopted draining reader is honestly `daemon` with
  both flags false, its bytes parsed live and its screen part inheritance.
  What `false` costs a reader is worth stating plainly, because a TUI paints
  differentially — it positions the cursor and writes only the cells it is
  changing. Every cell the child has not rewritten since the emulator was
  built holds nothing the child ever painted, so the screen mixes correct
  newly-painted cells with blanks where the session has text and stale text
  where the session has cleared, and the projection cannot tell them apart.
- **`source`** – which store answered: `daemon` (the daemon is the reader and
  rendered its live emulator), `viewer` (a viewer holds the pty and answered a
  pull), or `staleDaemon` (a viewer holds the pty, did not answer, and this is
  the daemon's emulator as it stood at attach). A consumer's policy is keyed
  on this field, so the policy cannot be applied by accident.
- **`age`** – how long ago the answering store's emulator last consumed a
  byte from the pty, so "stale" is a number rather than an adjective. One
  rule for every source: for `daemon` and `viewer` it is the live store's
  last byte and is ordinarily near zero; for `staleDaemon` it is the daemon
  emulator's last byte, which is at or before the attach — not the attach
  itself, since a session that went quiet before its viewer arrived is older
  than the attach makes it look. A store that has never consumed a byte
  reports the age of the store itself, counted from its adoption, so the
  field is never absent and a fresh, silent session reads as exactly as old
  as it is. Serialized as a non-negative integer of **milliseconds**, and
  measured on the daemon's monotonic clock (the injected `ContinuousClock`
  every delay in this codebase already takes), never on wall time — a
  threshold compared against wall time moves when the clock does, and a
  stale policy that can be defeated by a clock adjustment is not a policy.
  For `viewer`, the app reports its own monotonic interval since its last
  byte and the daemon forwards it; the interval is a duration, so no clock
  has to be shared.

The screen is one field short of that list. **`output: String`** — the lines
joined with `\n` — is kept for one reason, that scripts and skills read `tbd
terminal output` today and the CLI prints it, and it lives at the top level of
`TerminalOutputResult` rather than inside the screen: it is derived from
`lines`, carries no information of its own, and a copy nested in the screen
would put the same characters on the wire twice over for no consumer at all.
The Swift-side screen exposes it as a computed property, so one derivation
serves both.

The typed screen is the answer of the existing `terminal.output` method, not
a sibling method beside it. A second method would leave the first one
answering wrongly — an error that names the wrong cause — for every attached
session until the last consumer migrated, and the derived `output` field is
what lets every existing consumer keep reading without noticing the change.

### Two stores, and the pull that reaches the live one

The two-store model stands: the daemon's emulator is authoritative while
detached, the viewer's SwiftTerm is authoritative while attached. What this
design builds is the pull the model has always required.

- **Daemon as reader** – render the live emulator, `source: .daemon`. This is
  the path that exists today, minus the string.
- **Viewer as reader** – the daemon asks the app for the screen over the FD
  sidecar, which already carries daemon-originated frames with an app answer
  (`injection` / `injectionAck`, `SidecarFraming.swift:30-31`). Two frame
  types join them: `screenRequest`, naming the session, the line depth and a
  fresh `requestID`, and `screenReply`, carrying the typed screen under that
  same id. The id is what keeps a late answer from being taken for a current
  one: a reply whose request has expired or been superseded is counted and
  dropped, never applied to a later pull — the same late-answer discipline
  the courier keeps for injection acks. Adding a case is cheap in both
  directions — a peer built before the case existed skips the frame and logs
  it (`SidecarFraming.swift:19-24`) — so an old app simply never answers and
  the bound below covers it. The app answers from its live SwiftTerm through
  the same cell walk the handback preamble already uses
  (`Sources/TBDTerminalSerialization/TerminalCellWalk.swift`, driven by
  `TerminalSnapshotWriter` in the same module, which the handback invokes at
  `Sources/TBDApp/Terminal/TerminalPanelView.swift:1204-1208`), so the two
  stores project identically by construction. The answer is
  `source: .viewer`.

  The `requestID` is a UUID minted per request and unique for the request's
  lifetime, and the reply carries the session id beside it, because the
  sidecar is one app-wide connection carrying frames for every session. A
  pending request is scoped to the sidecar connection it was sent on: a
  reconnect discards every request outstanding on the old connection, and a
  reply arriving with a stale connection generation is dropped with the
  late-reply accounting above, never matched by id alone.
- **Viewer holds the pty and does not answer** – the pull is bounded on an
  injected clock. On expiry the daemon answers from the emulator it suspended
  at attach, `source: .staleDaemon`, `age` per the one rule above. The
  emulator is retained across an attach for exactly this — the acknowledgement
  suspends the daemon's reader and never stops it
  (`HolderRegistry.confirmAttach`), which is what the transport spec's
  "frozen-at-attach" fallback assumes. The memory cost is one emulator per
  attached session, which is the cost the transport spec already budgeted for
  every session.
- **No reader at all** – the session is gone or never adopted. An error, as
  today, and the error says which.

Each consumer declares what it does with `.staleDaemon`, and the declaration
is in the consumer, where a reviewer can see it:

- **The input-path oracle** – proceeds on the stale modes and records the
  source on the actuation row. This is the one place the design knowingly
  acts on possibly-stale information, and it gets its own section below.
- **The hibernation pending-input check** – fails closed, as the transport
  spec rules: a stale screen cannot prove the composer is empty. It fails
  closed on the other axis too, refusing a live `daemon` screen whose
  `contentObserved` is false, because a grid the emulator inherited blank can
  show a phantom composer where the session is idle and a blank one where
  somebody is typing — the two mistakes this rail exists to prevent, in one
  screen. That refusal has a name of its own: there is no tab to close, and
  the screen becomes checkable again when the daemon next starts the session.
- **Fleet supervision, `tbd terminal output`** – accept, and surface the
  source and age on stderr, plus the content caveat when `contentObserved` is
  false. A desk that reads `staleDaemon, 40 minutes` has learned something a
  string could never tell it, and a desk told that cells nobody has repainted
  since the daemon restarted may be stale or blank will not read a phantom
  composer line as the session's present state.

### The same object is the input side's mode oracle

`performHolderSend` composes a message once and hands it to the courier whole
— that atomicity is correct and stays. What changes is that the composition
consults the screen contract first, and the modes decide the bytes:

- **Bracketed paste on** – the body is wrapped in `ESC[200~` … `ESC[201~`
  and the submitting `\r` follows the end marker, all in one write. The
  message is still one message; the Enter is provably outside the paste,
  which is the property the tmux arm's two-act delivery had and the holder
  arm lost. A paste heuristic that keys on chunk shape sees an explicit paste
  and a separate keystroke, because that is what the bytes say.
- **Bracketed paste off** – bare bytes, as today. A shell at its prompt, or a
  program that never asked for bracketing, must not receive markers it will
  print.
The oracle is consulted at composition time, which is a moment, and the child
can change a mode between that moment and the write. That window exists on
tmux too — the server reads the pane's mode when it pastes, not when the
bytes land — and it is accepted here for the same reason: a mode that flips
mid-send produces a visible mis-paste, not a silent one.

### Named keys are supported, and they lean on the oracle

`--keys` works on the holder transport. The refusal that stands today
(`holderKeysRefusal`, `:2848-2852`) exists because the daemon had no way to
choose bytes for a key whose encoding depends on the child's mode; the oracle
is that way, and the table is built on it rather than deferred to the holder
`write` verb. The documented remedy for a stuck composer — `--keys "Escape
Enter"` — has to work on the transport where composers get stuck.

- **Mode-independent keys** – `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `BSpace`, `Space`,
  and `C-<x>` for the control characters. These encode the same way in every
  mode and the table carries them as fixed bytes.
- **Mode-dependent keys** – the arrows and the navigation keys (`Home`,
  `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`) select the application sequence (`ESCOA`) or
  the normal one (`ESC[A`) on the oracle's `applicationCursor`.
- **Pacing** – keys go one at a time through the existing `PacedKeySender`,
  for the reason its tmux use records: a redrawing TUI drops back-to-back
  keys.
- **Unknown keys** – a name the table does not carry is refused by name, as a
  tmux key the daemon cannot map is refused today. The table is small on
  purpose; it grows by evidence of a key somebody needed.

This restores a capability, and it also creates a dependency that a reader
must not miss: **the named-key table is load-bearing on the oracle's
accuracy.** A wrong `applicationCursor` sends `ESC[A` to a program waiting for
`ESCOA`, which the program reads as Escape followed by two printable
characters — a silently wrong keystroke, which is precisely the failure class
this design exists to end. The oracle's provenance is the guard: a key
composed against `staleDaemon` modes is recorded as such on the actuation row
(next section), so a mis-sent key is diagnosable afterwards even though it is
not detectable at the moment it is sent. Verification does not cover keys —
they reach no transcript — so for named keys the recorded source is the only
witness there is.

### Proceeding on stale modes

When a viewer holds the pty and does not answer the pull, the oracle composes
against the modes the daemon's emulator held when the viewer attached, and
records `modeSource: staleDaemon` with the age on the actuation row. This is
the residue of the design: the one place it knowingly proceeds on
information that may be wrong, and it should be read as one.

What a stale-mode send can get wrong, exactly:

- **Bracketed paste read as on when it is off** – the child receives
  `ESC[200~` and `ESC[201~` as bytes it never asked for. A program that does
  not understand them prints them, so the composer shows the markers around
  the text and the `\r` still submits whatever the program made of it. A
  shell at its prompt executes a line that begins with a marker.
- **Bracketed paste read as off when it is on** – the send goes as bare
  bytes, and the receiver's burst heuristic can absorb the `\r`. This is the
  defect the oracle exists to end, reappearing only on the stale path, and
  only when the child changed its paste mode during the attach.
- **`applicationCursor` wrong in either direction** – a named arrow key
  arrives as the wrong sequence, as the previous section describes.

Every one of those is a wrong *composition*, and a wrong composition is
visible in the composer or diagnosable from the row; none of them is a send
that vanishes with a `dispatched` record and nothing else. That is the
difference between this residue and the defects above.

Proceeding beats refusing for a reason specific to who sends when. A viewer
that does not answer is an app that is napping, wedged, or busy — and the
transport spec already observes that those states correlate with exactly the
moments supervision most wants to act. A refusal would make the daemon's
rails fail closed at those moments, every time, which turns a rare mis-paste
into a systematic stall of unattended work. Modes flip rarely — an agent TUI
sets bracketed paste once at startup and leaves it — so the stale answer is
usually the right one, and when it is not, the outcome is a visible
mis-paste rather than a silent loss.

The recorded source is what makes this honest rather than merely optimistic.
A row reading `dispatched, modeSource: staleDaemon (age 41 min)` tells a
person reading the record afterwards that the composition was a guess and
how old the guess was; the verifier's observation on the same row then says
whether the guess landed. A refusal would have carried the same honesty at
the price of the stall; a silent fallback would have carried neither.

Unobserved modes are the same residue reached from the other side, and the
asymmetry above decides them — but only for the children the asymmetry holds
for. A reading with `modesObserved: false` carries a fresh terminal's defaults
rather than anything the child was seen to do, so its `bracketedPaste: false`
is not evidence of anything. For a session running an agent TUI the oracle
composes as if bracketed paste were on and records `modesObserved: false` on
the row, because of the two ways it can be wrong only one leaves a trace: read
as off when it is on, the TUI's burst heuristic absorbs the `\r` and the
message sits in the composer with nothing to say why; read as on when it is
off, the child prints the markers, which somebody can see. Wrapping under
uncertainty buys the visible failure over the silent one.

The wrap is scoped to those burst-heuristic children, and a re-adopted **shell**
composes bare. A shell's line editor submits bare input of any length and has
no heuristic to fool, so a bare send never stalls there; wrapping one that
never asked for brackets would only hand a `sudo` or `ssh` prompt markers to
print, or a line made of them to run, in exchange for a stall that cannot
happen. Uncertainty is a reason to wrap only where composing bare fails
silently. An *observed* `false` is not uncertainty at all and composes bare for
any child.

### What this does not change

- **The holder still never reads** (`Sources/TBDHolder/Holder.swift:9-13`).
  The oracle lives in the daemon's composition step and is fed by whichever
  emulator reads; nothing about the holder's contract moves. When the holder
  `write` verb lands, the daemon composes exactly as here and hands the holder
  finished bytes.
- **The no-TUI-scraping rule stands.** The contract makes screen reads honest;
  it does not make them the right source for agent *state*. "Is the agent
  stuck" belongs on hook and transcript state, as the rule already says. The
  screen contract serves the readers that legitimately need a screen — the
  login driver, the pending-input check, a person running
  `tbd terminal output` — and the input composer, which needs modes and
  nothing else.

## Delivery verification on holder sends

### The verifier is transport-independent by construction

The delivery verifier observes a send by reading the **tail of the session's
transcript** for the dispatch envelope it typed
(`Sources/TBDDaemon/Actuation/DeliveryVerifier.swift:41-49`, `:354-368`), and
its own doc says why: "Never a pane read: screen text is a display surface,
not an API" (`:314`). The facts it consults are the terminal row's transcript
path, activity state and session id (`:10-28`). None of those is a tmux
coordinate. A holder-backed agent session reports its transcript path through
the same `SessionStart` hook as a tmux one, so the observation has everything
it needs.

Today the holder arm refuses `--verify` before composing anything
(`RPCRouter+TerminalHandlers.swift:3205-3208`, refusal text at `:2835-2839`),
and the comment justifying it says the verifier "re-reads a tmux pane, and
there is none" (`:3176-3177`). That misdescribes it. The one leg of the
mechanism that does touch a pane is the **evidence-bounded re-delivery**:
`redeliverVerifiedPayload` (`:3336-3400`) consults the pane, pastes through
tmux and presses Enter through tmux. That leg is a transport call, and it
routes the same way every other send does.

### What changes

- **The refusal is lifted.** A verify-armed send to a holder-backed agent
  session is composed by `performHolderSend`, delivered by the courier, and
  armed for observation exactly as the tmux arm arms it. Eligibility stays
  what `supportsDeliveryObservation` says (`:3453-3455`) — an agent kind with
  a transcript — and is transport-blind.
- **Re-delivery routes by transport, in the same change.** `redeliverVerifiedPayload`
  branches as the send handler does: a holder row composes through the oracle
  — recording its mode source like any other holder send — and delivers
  through the courier; the session-id re-check that guards against typing into
  a stranger (`:3368-3370`) is already transport-independent and runs on both
  arms. The pane consultation's holder equivalent is the registry's recorded
  child status — a child the holder reports exited is refused, as a dead pane
  is. The holder branch lands with the lifted refusal, never after it: a
  verification whose retry still pastes through tmux would observe a holder
  session and then re-deliver to a pane id that is empty by construction.
- **Provenance is per dispatch, not per act.** The retry recomposes against
  the modes as they are then, so its `modeSource` and age can differ from the
  first dispatch's. Each dispatch already writes its own outcome row to the
  append-only actuation log — the retry's row is what
  `DeliveryVerifier.runReCheckCycle` appends at
  `Sources/TBDDaemon/Actuation/DeliveryVerifier.swift:276-283` — and the
  mode source and age ride on that row, so every attempt carries its own
  immutable provenance and nothing is overwritten. A reader of the record
  sees two dispatches, each with the modes it was composed against, and the
  observation between them.
- **The daemon's own rails arm verification by default.** Sends originated by
  a daemon rail — fleet supervision nudges, queued prompts, the limit-resume
  actuator — are verify-armed on holder sessions whenever
  `delivery_verification_enabled` is on, without the caller passing
  `--verify`. A person or a script keeps opting in per send. The rails are the
  senders whose silence costs hours: nobody is looking at the screen when a
  desk nudges an agent at three in the morning, and the record is the only
  witness.
- **Default arming is a holder-transport rule.** Rails sending to a tmux
  session keep today's per-send opt-in. The tmux arm already delivers with
  explicit bracketing and a separate Enter, so it lacks the failure shape that
  motivates the default, and widening the soak to both transports at once
  widens the blast radius of any re-delivery bug to the whole fleet. Extending
  the default to tmux is cheap to do later on evidence and is not done here.
- **Nothing about the ladder changes.** Requested, dispatched, landed
  (`2026-07-26-fleet-supervision-design.md` §12) stays the record's shape; the
  third rung simply becomes reachable on the transport where it is needed
  most. `undetermined` is never retried, and the single retry is bounded by
  evidence — both rules unchanged.

### Where the halves meet

A verified send on the holder transport is: compose against the child's modes
(the oracle), write, observe the transcript (the verifier), retry once on
positive evidence of non-delivery, composing again against the modes as they
are then. The oracle is what makes the first attempt likely to land; the
verifier is what makes a failure to land loud within one observation deadline
instead of hours. A send that lands after retry is recorded as landed with two
dispatches between which the observation sits; a send that does not is
recorded as not landed, and that row is the signal this whole design exists to
emit.

## What stays silent, stated

- **Shell sessions have no transcript**, so verification cannot observe them.
  The oracle still serves them — bracketed paste off means bare bytes — and a
  shell in canonical mode never met the input-queue ceiling in the first
  place. The residue is a shell that received a send and did nothing, which
  is what a shell does with a command it does not understand.
- **A send composed against stale modes** can mis-paste or mis-key, as
  "Proceeding on stale modes" states. Visible in the composer, recorded on
  the row, and never a vanished send.
- **A mode that flips between query and write** produces a visible mis-paste.
  Accepted, as above.
- **Named keys reach no transcript**, so verification cannot observe them.
  The recorded mode source is their only witness.
- **A viewer that never answers a pull** yields `staleDaemon` for as long as
  it holds the pty. That is the transport spec's alive-but-silent arm, and it
  is now a labeled answer with an age instead of an error that names the
  wrong cause.
- **An app that dies with an injection remainder in its outbox** has acked
  `written: true` for bytes that never landed. Verification is what turns that
  residue into a not-landed row; the outbox spec names it and this design does
  not re-open it.

## Reconcilers

Per
[`2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md`](2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md):
**this design introduces no new kind of durable resource and no new creation
path to one.** The retained emulator is daemon memory released with the
session's reader; the sidecar frames are memory in two processes bounded by a
clock; the verification arming is a task the verifier already owns and
forgets on completion; the actuation rows are appended to a log that already
exists, under a query-time delivery rule that leaves nothing stale.

## Flag

- **The screen contract** is an additive change to an RPC result and a
  correction to the send composition. It ships under `pty_holder_enabled`,
  which has never shipped on and wraps the whole path it corrects, for the
  reason the single-typist spec gives for its own gate
  (`2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md:396-402`): a second column
  would keep selectable a quadrant (holder on, mode-blind composition) that
  is known to stall agents.
- **Verification on holder sends** rides `delivery_verification_enabled`,
  the existing default-off soak flag for the observation machinery. Lifting
  the holder refusal adds no reachable behavior while that flag is off, and
  default arming for daemon rails is gated on it.

## Testing

- **The whitelist is structural.** Constructing a screen from a grid holding
  a NUL, a control character or a wide glyph's trailing cell yields a space, a
  refusal, or an omission respectively — asserted on the constructed value,
  never on a render site.
- **Source and age.** The three answers are each constructible in a test: a
  detached session answers `daemon`; an attached session with a responding
  app answers `viewer` and its lines match the app's own serializer; an
  attached session with a silent app answers `staleDaemon` after the bound on
  an injected clock, with the emulator's at-attach content.
- **The oracle decides the bytes.** With bracketed paste on, a submitting send
  produces `ESC[200~`, body, `ESC[201~`, `\r` in one write; with it off, bare
  bytes and `\r`. With `applicationCursor` on, `--keys Up` produces `ESCOA`;
  off, `ESC[A`. Each case asserts on the bytes the courier receives.
- **The paste-burst shape, end to end.** A real pty with a raw-mode child that
  implements the burst heuristic receives an enveloped send above the
  threshold and observes a submit — the test that discriminates the Enter
  loss.
- **Verification on the holder arm.** A verify-armed holder send is armed
  rather than refused; an observation finding the envelope records landed;
  one not finding it records not landed and re-delivers through the courier,
  not through tmux; a daemon-rail send is armed without `--verify` when the
  flag is on and not when it is off.
- **The stale-source policies.** The hibernation check refuses on
  `staleDaemon`; the oracle proceeds, and the actuation row carries
  `modeSource: staleDaemon` with an age, asserted on the row rather than on a
  log line.
- **Named keys.** `Escape Enter` produces the fixed bytes in every mode; an
  unknown key name is refused by name and writes nothing; keys are paced
  through `PacedKeySender` with the same interval the tmux arm uses.

## Out of scope, named so nobody re-derives them

- **Jiggle scoping.** The size jiggle is load-bearing on exactly one edge —
  re-adoption after a daemon restart, where the emulator is empty — because
  an Ink-style TUI's runtime emits a resize event only on a real geometry
  change, so a bare `SIGWINCH` heals nothing there. It is redundant on attach
  (`confirmAttach` in `HolderRegistry.swift`: the preamble already carries a current screen
  from an emulator that was draining continuously, and the viewer already owns
  the size ioctl per the transport spec's "resize follows the reader") and on
  handback (`takeBackFromViewer`: the preamble carries the app's screen). When it does run,
  the grid should move with the tty so the emulator is never at a width the
  child is not, and adoption should assert the size so a stranded width heals.
  Its own spec.
- **A per-session health record** over RPC — owner, last-drain time, outbox
  depth, tty size against grid size, child modes and liveness. Every fact is
  already in daemon memory. The screen contract's `source` and `age` are the
  two of them a reader needs now; the rest is its own spec.
- **The reader-count log.** The transport spec promises an always-on
  assertion that logs loudly on a second live drain loop; what exists is a
  test-facing counter (`HolderRegistry.swift:297-306`, `:878`) with no log at
  `> 1`. One line of code, and not this spec's.

## Sequencing against single-typist

The holder `write` verb and the rest of
[`2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md`](2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md)
are untouched in substance and **land after this design.** The reasons are
the two boundaries this document is about:

- **The verb moves the writer away from the modes.** Under single-typist the
  holder finishes every injection from its own outbox, and the holder is the
  process that structurally never reads the master and so has no emulator to
  ask. The daemon's composition step is the only place a mode-aware
  composition can live on either side of that change. Building the oracle
  into that step first means the verb, when it lands, receives bytes that are
  already right; building the verb first means every injection reaches the
  child faster and lands inside the same paste burst.
- **Verification is what proves the verb works.** A holder outbox that
  completes a 4 KB prompt is only known to have worked if something observes
  the prompt in the transcript. With verification on the holder transport
  before the verb, the verb's soak has a witness from its first send.

Nothing in single-typist's contract changes: one injection writer, a paste
lease, a keystroke hold, completion bounded by the child's death. Its
"Named-key sends" and "trailing Enter absorbed" residues are closed by this
design rather than carried forward, and its text should be read with those
two entries struck.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Keep the string and add fields beside it.** A string with a `stale: Bool`
  next to it is the same lie with a footnote: consumers that match on text
  keep matching on text, and the whitelist has nowhere to live. The typed
  lines are what make the invariant enforceable at construction.
- **The app streams its screen to the daemon continuously.** The transport
  spec rejected this as a standing per-byte tax; a pull on demand costs
  nothing between reads.
- **Make the app the oracle always.** The app is not always attached, and
  when it is not the daemon's emulator is the only store there is. Keying on
  `source` is the same model the reads already use.
- **Ask the child its modes.** The child is a program, not a terminal; there
  is no query it answers. The emulator that parsed its `DECSET`s is the only
  witness, which is why the oracle is the emulator.
- **Split the Enter into a second, paced write on the holder.** Mirrors the
  tmux arm's two acts, but reintroduces a message split across a routing
  decision — the hazard "one message" exists to prevent — and it treats the
  symptom while leaving the composer blind to bracketing. Wrapping inside one
  message keeps atomicity and fixes the cause.
- **Observe delivery from the screen.** A composer that shows the text is not
  evidence the agent read it; the transcript is. The no-scraping rule already
  says so, and the verifier already obeys it.
- **Arm verification on every send by default.** A person typing
  `tbd terminal send` at a session they are watching does not need a
  transcript read a minute later, and at-least-once re-delivery is a decision
  a person should make per send. Rails have no person; they get the default.
- **Refuse a send when the oracle cannot answer.** Never mis-pastes, and
  that is its whole case. Its cost is that every supervision send fails
  closed whenever the app naps, wedges or is busy — the moments that
  correlate with supervision needing to send — so a rare visible mis-paste is
  traded for a systematic stall of unattended work. The recorded
  `staleDaemon` provenance keeps the refusal's honesty without that cost.
- **A new RPC method beside `terminal.output`.** Leaves the old method
  answering wrongly for every attached session until the last consumer
  migrates; the derived `output` field makes the in-place change invisible to
  consumers that have not.
- **A daemon-to-app pull over the RPC subscription channel.** That channel
  only pushes deltas today; a request-reply pair on it is a new direction on
  a channel with no reply discipline, where the sidecar already has one
  (`injection` / `injectionAck`).
- **Stop the daemon's emulator at attach.** Makes `staleDaemon` an
  empty screen with an age — honest and useless. Suspending it costs one
  emulator per attached session, which the transport spec budgets for every
  session regardless.
- **Keep refusing `--keys` until the holder `write` verb lands.** Leaves the
  documented remedy for a stuck composer refused on the transport where
  composers get stuck, and the verb changes nothing about where the key
  table's mode knowledge has to come from.
- **Keep the holder `--verify` refusal.** Keeps the record's third rung
  unreachable on the transport that needs it most, on the strength of a
  comment that misdescribes what the verifier reads.
- **Lift the refusal but leave rails on per-send opt-in.** The rails that
  stall for hours keep sending unverified unless every rail author remembers
  a flag; the whole point of the default is that a rail has no person to
  remember it.
- **Default arming on tmux sessions too, for symmetry.** The tmux arm lacks
  the failure shape that motivates the default, and widening a soak to both
  transports at once doubles the blast radius of any re-delivery bug.
  Cheap to revisit on evidence.
- **Ship the holder `write` verb first.** A faster path to the same stall,
  with the composer moved further from the modes it needs and no witness for
  the verb's own soak. See "Sequencing against single-typist".
