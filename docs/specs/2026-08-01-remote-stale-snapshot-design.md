# Remote provider stale-snapshot visibility

## Problem

TBD persists the last successful remote-session inventory so users can still
inspect and attach to known sessions after a provider error. Before this
change, a failed full-list refresh left those cached rows looking live and
kept inventory-dependent mutations enabled. A remote host can be healthy while
its unbounded `list` response is truncated by the transport, so a
provider-path failure was indistinguishable from real remote work: TBD
presented stale state with false confidence.

## Decision

The provider manager owns one inventory-health boundary. Every successful full
snapshot records its time in the same database transaction as the mirror update.
The timestamp is separate from per-session `lastSeen`, because the independent
events stream can update rows without proving that the full inventory works.
After a later full-list failure, persisted active
rows are projected as unknown and the provider status includes the last
successful snapshot time. A daemon restart recovers that time from the dedicated
persisted `tbd_meta` snapshot timestamp before publishing degraded health.

While a previously successful inventory is stale, TBD keeps read-only and
recovery actions available: Attach, Log, Copy, and Pin. It blocks Create, Stop,
Send, and Rename in both the app and daemon RPC layer because each mutation
depends on inventory state that TBD can no longer verify. A first-ever provider
failure has no cached snapshot to misrepresent and retains the prior behavior.

Successful non-list verbs do not clear inventory degradation; only a complete
full-list refresh can re-establish authoritative state. Provider errors shown
in the UI are bounded and redact the known oversized/truncated payload shape.

One "stale snapshot" rule serves both the mutation gate and the display
projection, and it lives in one place (`RemoteProviderStatus.isStaleSnapshot`)
that the daemon actor and the wire DTO both call. Two same-named
implementations had already drifted once: the gate refused mutations while the
session list went on rendering cached rows as running.

Accepted tradeoff: `health` is a single per-provider slot shared by every verb,
so a transient non-`list` failure (a `log`, a `send`) marks the provider
degraded and therefore gates mutations and demotes rows until the next
successful poll, up to one poll interval later. It self-heals and errs toward
blocking, so it is UX noise rather than a safety hole. Separating list-health
from verb-health is the real fix and is deliberately out of scope here.

Fail direction is decided by what the daemon can prove, not by convenience.
"No successful snapshot was ever recorded" is positive knowledge — the mirror
was never authoritative, so there is nothing to misrepresent and mutations
stay enabled. A freshness read that *fails* proves nothing, so it gates
instead: it is recorded distinctly from a confirmed absence, reports its own
health text, and clears as soon as a read succeeds or a live snapshot lands.
Conflating the two would let a database error silently buy back the exact
false confidence this change removes.

## Boundaries

- No provider protocol, credential, or remote host changes.
- No automatic retry, restart, stop, or other remote mutation.
- No TUI screen scraping.
- Cached rows remain attachable because provider session IDs are still useful
  even when their liveness is unknown.
- The daemon gate is authoritative; app disabling is explanatory defense in
  depth.

## Verification

- A healthy snapshot followed by a list failure demotes cached active rows and
  records snapshot age.
- Restart recovery reconstructs the last successful timestamp.
- Full-list recovery restores authoritative status.
- Non-list successes cannot clear stale inventory health.
- Create, Stop, Send, and Rename fail closed at the RPC boundary while Attach
  and Log remain usable.
- First-ever malformed output says that no successful snapshot exists rather
  than claiming that one is displayed.
- An unreadable persisted freshness row gates mutations and claims no age,
  and stops gating once a snapshot succeeds.
