# Migrating terminal sessions off tmux onto per-session pty holders

**Status:** Approved design. Not yet implemented.

**Companion evidence:** the measurement and research records under
[`docs/research/2026-08-30-terminal-session-persistence/`](../research/2026-08-30-terminal-session-persistence/)
— field measurements of the tmux path, a full source read of iTerm2's session
restoration, and a prior-art survey of every shipping system found in this
space. This spec restates the decision-critical numbers so it stands alone, and
defers to those records for methodology and file:line citations.

## Summary

TBD today keeps agent sessions alive across daemon and app restarts by running
them under tmux. This design replaces tmux with a **per-session holder
process**: a minimal supervisor that `forkpty()`s the job, holds the pty
master, and hands the master over `SCM_RIGHTS` to whoever should be reading —
the app while a viewer is attached, the daemon otherwise. The attached path
becomes a raw pty read in the app with no other process involved, which is the
arrangement iTerm2 has shipped for years; the daemon's always-on presence
covers the detached-output window iTerm2 structurally cannot.

The justification is **scaling headroom, not current latency**. At quiet load
tmux costs 1.1 ms p50 per keystroke and is imperceptible; this design does not
claim to fix any latency a user feels today. What the measurements show is that
a raw pty is *flat* under load (never exceeded 5 ms at any load including 117)
while tmux degrades superlinearly (p90 of 9.3 → 12.7 → 139 ms as load rises —
the 139 ms bucket is n=4 and directional only, so read it as a direction, not a
figure; the 9.3 → 12.7 growth is the solid part and is already the whole point,
since flat means flat), because a tmux keystroke costs two extra process
wakeups whose latency is scheduling delay. tmux is therefore the component that breaks first as the
fleet grows. The design point is roughly twice the present fleet: **~150
concurrent sessions at sustained load ≥ 100** on one machine.

## The measured basis

Three findings from the companion records shape everything below.

- **The cost of tmux is process wakeups, and they track load.** A raw pty's
  echo happens in the kernel line discipline inside `write()`, with no process
  wakeup at all, which is why it is indifferent to load. A tmux keystroke is
  two server wakeups (read the key, read the echo) plus the reader's own; the
  server's actual work is ~40 µs, and the rest is waiting to be scheduled.
  The tmux *client* is not in the steady-state path — it hands its stdin to
  the server over `SCM_RIGHTS` at attach — so there is no client relay to
  delete; the only saving available is the server wakeups and the redundant
  VT parse.
- **TBD's live path is already the good arrangement, minus tmux.** The app
  spawns a `tmux attach` client per viewer and SwiftTerm reads that client's
  pty natively; the control-mode fanout is gated off by default. There is no
  intermediary left to remove first.
- **Holding a pty master elsewhere is proven, and draining is the hard half.**
  Passing a master over `SCM_RIGHTS` to another process which then does direct
  I/O works on Darwin, and the shell sees no SIGHUP when the passing process
  dies. But a supervisor that merely parks the fd wedges its child once the
  kernel tty buffer fills — observed directly — so exactly one process must be
  reading at all times that output flows, and the transfer of that role needs
  an acknowledged edge.

Additionally, tmux imposes a throughput cost this design removes: every byte a
program prints is parsed twice — once by the tmux server into its grid, then
re-rendered as a fresh escape stream that SwiftTerm parses again — with tmux's
output flow control in between. On the new attached path the bytes are read
once and parsed once, by the app. For the dominant workload (a full-screen
agent TUI repainting continuously) this is a straight bandwidth win in addition
to the latency-flatness win.

## Design overview

Three roles, three processes:

- **The holder** — one tiny process per session. It `forkpty()`s the job, owns
  the pty master for the session's whole life, and **never reads it**. It
  survives daemon restarts, app restarts, and crashes of both. Holder death
  is session death — by policy as well as by mechanism, see "Holder death"
  below — so it is kept small enough to essentially never change.
- **The daemon** — the arbiter of who reads, and the **default reader**. While
  no viewer is attached it drains the master into a headless terminal
  emulator, so unattended agents never stall and reattachment has a screen to
  show. Because the holder owns the master, the daemon is freely restartable:
  a daemon restart no longer touches any live terminal.
- **The app (viewer)** — while attached, reads and writes the master directly
  through a dup received over the existing FD sidecar. Keystroke echo is
  kernel → app: 0.1 ms, flat under load, identical in mechanism to iTerm2's
  attached path.

The single-reader invariant, in one sentence: **the daemon reads exactly the
sessions that no live, connected app has claimed — and when it cannot yet
know, it errs toward reading nothing**, because not-reading costs recoverable
delay — stalled output, and jobs that finish meanwhile unable to complete
their exit — while double-reading is silent corruption (each `read()` steals
bytes the other reader never sees).

## The holder

### Contract

- **Spawn.** The daemon spawns the holder with `posix_spawn`, and the holder
  calls `setsid()` itself as its first act. `posix_spawn` rather than
  fork+exec because the lock descriptor rides a `dup2` **file action** (see
  the creation lock below), which has no equivalent in a hand-rolled
  fork+exec — and because a daemon that forks is a daemon whose child
  inherits whatever locks its other threads happened to hold. `setsid`
  detaches the holder from any process group that could signal it (the
  iTerm2 lesson: without it, a Ctrl-C aimed at the parent kills the
  supervisor and strands every session); the holder does it rather than the
  spawner so the guarantee holds however it was launched. The holder then `forkpty()`s the
  job, making it both the master's owner and the child's parent; it reaps the
  child via SIGCHLD. When the daemon exits, the holder orphans to launchd and
  carries on. SIGHUP and SIGPIPE are ignored.
- **Lifetime.** The holder exits when its child exits — but only after
  reporting the child's exit status to the daemon, or timing out trying
  (bounded, injected clock). Exit status is data the session lifecycle wants,
  and the holder is the only process guaranteed to observe it. If the report
  never lands (daemon down through the whole timeout), the session record's
  status becomes exited, status unknown — implementations must not fabricate
  one. On the way out the holder unlinks its socket.
- **Rendezvous and identity.** One Unix socket per holder, at a
  `TBDConstants`-derived path under the TBD home directory (honoring
  `TBD_HOME`), named by the session UUID. Session identity is the UUID TBD
  already persists — stronger than iTerm2's *(socket number, child pid)*
  pairing. Socket paths observe `sun_path`-length discipline: the sessions
  directory stays shallow, and the length is checked before every `bind` and
  `connect`. The socket is bound with owner-only permissions. One client at a
  time, enforced holder-side: a second connection is accepted and immediately
  rejected with a sentinel protocol version.
- **Creation is serialized by an advisory lock.** A socket file alone cannot
  distinguish a live holder from the corpse of a SIGKILLed one, and `bind`
  refuses a path that already exists — so "unlink the stale socket, then bind"
  is a race two spawners can both win, leaving one holder bound to a path the
  other has already unlinked and a session nobody can reach. Beside each
  socket sits a zero-byte lock file on the same UUID. A spawner takes an
  exclusive `flock` on it before unlinking or binding anything; the descriptor
  carrying the lock is handed to the holder **through a `posix_spawn` `dup2`
  file action**, and the daemon closes its own copy, so the holder alone holds
  it for its whole life. The file action matters more than it looks, and the
  obvious alternative is wrong: clearing `FD_CLOEXEC` on the *daemon's* own
  descriptor exposes that lock to **every other concurrent spawn in the
  daemon**, so an unrelated child inherits it and keeps that session's UUID
  unreclaimable until that child happens to die. `dup2` clears the flag on the
  child's copy alone. This was measured as a real flake, not reasoned about. A spawner that cannot take the lock has learned that a
  live holder owns that UUID **without connecting to it**, and backs off
  instead of clearing the path — which is what makes the stale-daemon hazard
  named under Reconciliation safe rather than merely detectable. The kernel
  drops the lock when the holder dies, so nothing can leak but an empty file,
  swept with the socket by `OrphanGC`.

  Two rules keep that safe against holder versions. **A socket with no
  sibling lock is unowned-but-unproven, never unowned**: the spawner must
  handshake the existing socket before clearing it, and a rejected or
  timed-out handshake means leave it alone. Absence of a lock is not evidence
  of absence of a holder. And **the rendezvous layout is frozen at v1** —
  socket name, lock name, lock semantics — deliberately outside the
  protocol's version negotiation, because it has to be interpretable *before*
  a connection exists, which is exactly when no version has been exchanged.
  A future holder needing a different rendezvous gets a different directory,
  not a different convention in the same one.
- **Protocol.** Minimal and versioned from day one. Verbs: report the child
  (pid, tty name, launch parameters, alive/exited status) and hand over a
  master dup; write input to the master (see "Input is not arbitrated, but it
  is serialized"); report exit status; forget the child (close the master and
  stop reporting, so a killed session cannot be resurrected — iTerm2's
  preemptive wait). The version field is load-bearing: long-lived sessions keep running
  old holder binaries, so the daemon must interoperate with every holder
  version that has ever shipped. This is the standing argument for keeping
  the holder near-featureless forever.
- **Environment and launch parameters.** The session's environment (including
  `envOverrides`) is applied at spawn by the daemon and passed through the
  holder to the child, replacing today's tmux `-e` delivery. The base it is
  applied over is the daemon's own environment with the identity of whatever
  launched it removed — the enclosing Claude Code session's variables, TBD's
  own per-terminal exports, and the enclosing tmux pane's coordinates — while
  installation-wide configuration such as `TBD_HOME` keeps flowing. A daemon
  restarted from inside an agent session exports that session's identity: a
  Claude Code that inherits `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` reads itself as a
  nested child, with no peer-registry row and no transcript, and an inherited
  terminal incarnation id fails TBD's SessionStart guard against a fresh row
  that has none, costing the job its session id, its transcript path and its
  activity updates. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is judged by value: one under this
  installation's profiles directory is minted by TBD per spawn and so is
  identity, while any other value is the user's configuration and stays.
  `TERM` is pinned to the value tmux gives a pane rather than inherited, since
  it describes the terminal the job draws into and not the launcher. The same
  scrub is applied to the tmux server's own spawn, which is the pane's
  inherited base on that transport; to the daemon's own environment at startup,
  covering every child it spawns by plain inheritance; and — since a server
  outlives daemon restarts and hands its baked-in environment to every new
  window — to an existing server in place when the daemon next ensures it. That
  in-place repair covers TBD's own exports and Codex's, and leaves Claude
  Code's: a running pane holds its own copy and reads it as ambient only while
  the server's global copy is there too, so the panes that already depend on it
  keep it until the server is recycled. The
  holder retains the launch request and replays it on demand, so a re-adopting
  daemon can reconstruct what is running without trusting the database.
- **Binary.** A new small SPM executable target. No copying the binary out of
  the build tree: a running holder's executable image survives rebuilds and
  build-directory reclamation (iTerm2 copies its server binary only because
  its auto-updater deletes the bundle out from under running servers, a
  hazard TBD does not have). The consequence — old sessions run old holders —
  is handled by the protocol versioning above.

### Why per-session

The holder is the process whose crash kills its sessions' ptys, so blast
radius dominates the granularity choice. A per-session holder's bug costs one
session; its lifecycle is self-reclaiming in the common case (exit on child
exit); its socket needs no child multiplexing; and upgrading the holder
binary — the hardest problem in this space, which Superset solves with a
successor-spawn fd-inheritance dance — is sidestepped entirely, because new
sessions simply get the new binary while old ones keep the old. At the design
point this is ~150 processes, which is trivial on macOS. The daemon's fd
budget is likewise a non-issue: it already raises `RLIMIT_NOFILE` at startup
(`raiseFileDescriptorLimit` in `Sources/TBDDaemon/Daemon.swift`) far beyond
150 master dups plus 150 holder sockets.

### Holder death

The daemon holds a master dup, so a holder crash does not by itself kill the
child: the kernel's fd refcount keeps the pty alive — the same mechanism
Superset exploits on purpose for daemon upgrades. The policy is that it kills
the session anyway, promptly and deliberately. The daemon watches its
connection to each holder; when a holder dies while its child lives, the
daemon kills the child's **process group** — the child is the session leader
of the pty's own session, courtesy of `forkpty`, so the group is the natural
closure of the job rather than one pid — verifying process identity
(executable and start time) before signalling, then closes its dups and marks
the session exited with a distinct reason (holder lost) rather than a generic
exit.

Two honest limits on that kill, neither new to this design. Identity
verification narrows the pid-reuse window but does not close it: nothing makes
"check identity" and "signal" atomic on Darwin, and the residual race is the
same one every pid-based reclaimer in TBD already runs. And a descendant that
deliberately leaves the group — `setsid`, a double fork, `nohup`, `disown` —
is outside the closure and survives, exactly as it survives a tmux pane kill
today. Reclaiming deliberate escapees is a standing fleet-wide problem that
belongs to `AgentReaper`, not to the transport; this design neither worsens
it nor claims to solve it.

The alternative — carrying the session on the daemon's own dup, marked
degraded — was rejected: it preserves in-flight work only until the next
daemon restart kills the session anyway, at the price of a permanent extra
session state and an ownership story with an exception in it. Holder crashes
are expected to be vanishingly rare precisely because the holder is small and
frozen; predictability is worth more than softening a rare event.

Recovery follows the transcript. For a Claude session the conversation up to
the last persisted turn survives on disk regardless, and a respawn with
`claude --resume <session-id>` continues it (any revive affordance must pass
`--fork-session`; a bare `--resume` reuses the session UUID). The in-flight
turn and unsubmitted composer input are lost — the same ladder as any process
death today, and no worse than a tmux server crash is now, with blast radius
one session rather than a repo's worth. Because the daemon knows why the
session died, the distinct exit reason enables a natural follow-on, out of
scope for this design: a UI affordance that revives the session in place.

## Reader arbitration

Each session has exactly one reader at any moment: the app, the daemon, or —
transiently — nobody. "Transiently" is doing real work in that sentence: a
no-reader window is safe in the sense that nothing is lost or corrupted, but
it is not free, because a job that finishes inside one cannot complete its
exit until draining resumes (see Daemon death). All transitions are arbitrated by the daemon,
which is also the fallback reader, so the acknowledged edge ("you read now, I
have stopped") is an in-process state transition plus one acked fd-vend, not a
distributed protocol.

- **Attach.** The app requests a session over the existing RPC. The daemon
  **quiesces** before it snapshots anything: it lets any in-flight `read()`
  finish and feeds every byte it already holds into its emulator, so no byte
  is stranded in a buffer the app will never see. Only then does it render its
  headless emulator's screen and retained scrollback into an escape-sequence
  **snapshot preamble** and send the preamble plus the master dup over the FD
  sidecar. The app feeds the preamble into SwiftTerm first, then goes live on
  the fd, then jiggles (see below). Reattach therefore paints the last-known
  screen instantly, as tmux does today. Ownership transfers on the app's
  acknowledgement, not on the send. A failed vend or a lost ack does **not**
  license an unconditional resume, because a lost ack and a lost app are
  indistinguishable on the wire and the app may already be live on its dup —
  resuming there would be the double read this whole design exists to prevent.
  So the daemon applies the same liveness gate as App death below: app
  confirmed gone, resume reading and the session is detached again; app alive
  or not yet determined, stay off the fd and await reconnect and re-claim. The
  invariant is "at most one reader", so the failure direction is always toward
  reading nothing until liveness says otherwise — accepting a recoverable
  stall over an unrecoverable corruption.
- **Detach.** The mirror image, carrying the same ordering discipline in the
  opposite direction: the app stops reading and closes its dup, and **only
  then** tells the daemon. The detach notice carries a **snapshot preamble of
  the app's own**, produced by the same serializer attach uses in the other
  direction; the daemon resets its emulator, replays that preamble, and only
  then resumes reading. This is what makes the handback symmetric, and it is
  load-bearing rather than tidy: the jiggle heals only programs that repaint
  on SIGWINCH, so without the handback a detach from a plain shell would leave
  the daemon's store frozen at the last attach until new output happened to
  arrive. One snapshot per detach is not the streaming handback rejected below
  — it is O(1) per reader change, not per byte. The
  close-before-notify order is what preserves the single-reader invariant — a
  notify-first detach would put the daemon on the fd while the app's last
  `read()` is still outstanding, which is the double-reader corruption in
  miniature. An app that dies mid-detach needs no special handling: the fd
  closes with the process and the app-death path below covers it.
- **App death.** A sidecar disconnect alone is not death: the sidecar has a
  designed reconnect path, so a socket-level drop can leave the app alive,
  holding its dups, still reading — and seizing then is exactly the
  double-reader corruption this design exists to avoid. On disconnect the
  daemon first checks whether the app process is alive, using the same
  identity-verified check the holder-death kill uses — recorded pid plus
  executable and start time — so a reused pid cannot make a dead app look
  alive and stall the fleet. Gone: every session
  it held reverts to daemon-read, with a jiggle, no cooperation from the dead
  process needed. Alive: the daemon stays off the fds and treats the drop
  like the startup grace window — await reconnect and re-claim, seize only on
  confirmed process death.
- **Daemon death.** Attached sessions are untouched — the app keeps its fds
  and keeps painting through the entire daemon outage. Detached sessions have
  no reader: their writers block on the kernel tty buffer, which is
  backpressure, not loss, and drains when the daemon returns.

  **A detached job also cannot finish exiting while its output sits unread**,
  which is a stronger consequence than backpressure and was measured rather
  than predicted. The job is its pty's session leader, and the kernel's process
  teardown waits on the terminal's output queue before revoking it — so a job
  that exits with anything unread stops in a half-exited state until somebody
  drains. A few bytes of ordinary echo are enough. `waitpid` then correctly
  reports nothing, so the holder observes no status and has none to send.

  The consequence for the design is that **the daemon's drain is a liveness
  requirement, not a convenience**. It is what lets detached jobs die at all,
  not merely what keeps their screens current. Two things follow. Through a
  daemon outage, detached sessions that finish accumulate half-exited rather
  than exiting and waiting to be reported — they complete when the daemon
  returns and drains, so this costs latency in the exit path rather than
  correctness. And **whichever process currently holds the fd must drain it
  unconditionally** — no lazy reads, no draining only when someone asks for a
  screen, no pausing while a session still has a live job. A reader that stops
  reading is not merely falling behind; it is holding jobs open.

  That constrains the reader, not the arbitration. The windows where nobody
  reads — the attach liveness gate, the alive-but-silent arm, a daemon outage
  — are deliberate and stay exactly as specified above: erring toward *no*
  reader is still correct, because a double reader corrupts silently while an
  absent one only delays. What changes is the price of those windows. They do
  not merely stall output; a job that finishes inside one cannot complete its
  exit until somebody drains. That is an argument for keeping such windows
  short and loud, not for reading during them.
- **Daemon startup (re-adoption).** The new daemon connects to every holder
  and adopts a master dup, but **reads nothing yet**. Every app-liveness
  question below is the identity-verified check described under App death,
  never a bare `kill(pid, 0)`. If no app process is alive, it becomes reader
  of everything immediately. If an app process is alive, it waits for that app's sidecar handshake, which carries the list of
  sessions the app holds fds for; claimed sessions stay app-owned and
  everything else begins draining. The wait is bounded by a grace window on
  an injected clock; on expiry the daemon re-checks app liveness — app gone,
  drain everything; app alive but silent, stay off the fds, log loudly, and
  raise a user-visible notification. A claim arriving after draining began is
  handled as an ordinary attach. The database records attach state as an
  observability hint only; it is never the arbiter, because a persisted row
  cannot answer a liveness question.

The alive-but-silent arm is an acknowledged limitation: while an app process
exists but never (re)connects, no detached session drains — a fleet-wide
stall of unattended work, visible as the notification above plus writers
blocked on full tty buffers **and jobs that finish during the stall unable to
complete their exit** (see the drain-liveness note under Daemon death). The
alternative — draining sessions a database hint says were detached — trades a
visible, recoverable stall for a chance of silent corruption, and is
rejected. The stall is still the right trade, but it is a larger one than
"writers wait": nothing is lost or corrupted, and everything resumes the
moment the app reconnects or its process dies, yet a session whose agent
finished mid-stall stays half-exited until then rather than being merely
quiet. That sharpens the case for the notification being loud, and for the
grace window being bounded rather than open-ended.

This arbitration was checked against the restart script's actual sequencing
(daemon bounces first, then the app): during a full development restart,
attached sessions keep painting through the daemon swap and go dark only for
the app's own bounce; detached sessions get a few seconds of harmless
backpressure. The daemon-only restart path — a live app throughout — is the
scenario the claim handshake exists for, and ordinary development restarts
exercise it continuously.

### Input is not arbitrated, but it is serialized

Reading the master is exclusive; writing is not — and a `write()` to a tty is
not atomic, so two processes writing one pty can shear each other's bytes. The
sharp case is bracketed paste: bytes arriving between `ESC[200~` and `ESC[201~`
are swallowed into the pasted text, and a torn marker leaves the TUI's paste
state desynchronized.

Two writers exist for any session: the person at the keyboard, and the daemon
(`tbd terminal send`, queued prompts, supervision nudges). The person writes
directly, because routing a keystroke through a second process is the latency
this transport exists to remove. Every daemon injection is therefore routed by
**who is reading that session's pty right now** (`HolderInjectionCourier`):

- **Detached** — nobody else is on the pty, so the daemon writes to its own
  dup. The ordinary case, and the only one that is not a fallback.
- **Attached** — the daemon puts an `injection` frame on the app sidecar and
  waits for the app's `injectionAck`. The app writes the bytes through the
  viewer's single serialization point, so for the span of that write the app is
  the session's only writer as well as its only reader, and the concurrency
  does not exist.
- **No usable answer before the ack deadline** — the daemon writes anyway.

That last rule fails **open**, and the cost is stated rather than hidden. A
missing ack does not mean the injection was not delivered: the app may have
written it and had the ack lost or merely delayed, which App Nap can cause by
coalescing a backgrounded app's work far past any deadline worth waiting on. So
the fallback can deliver an injection **twice**. That is the at-least-once
versus at-most-once fork, taken knowingly in favour of at-least-once — a
duplicated prompt is visible and recoverable, a silently dropped one strands an
agent indefinitely with nothing to see. An ack arriving after its injection was
already written directly is recorded and dropped, never used to retract or
dedupe the write that happened; acking before writing would trade a visible
duplicate for exactly the invisible loss this rejects.

The fallback has a descriptor to write to in every attached state, because
the daemon's reader is retained across an attach rather than released at the
acknowledgement: it is suspended, off the pty, and still holding its dup. The
one-reader invariant is about readers, and multiple writers to a master are
fine. That retention is also what keeps the daemon's emulator available as
the frozen-at-attach store described under "Two stores, reconciled on demand"
below, and the emulator's modes are what
[`2026-09-05-child-as-contract-party-design.md`](2026-09-05-child-as-contract-party-design.md)
composes input against.

The viewer's half of the arrangement is what keeps an injection out of a
paste's markers. Its outgoing queue is the only place that sees both the
person's keystrokes and the daemon's injected bytes, so it holds an injection
that arrives while a paste is open and releases it, in order, when the paste
closes. The hold is **bounded, and its bound is strictly shorter than the
daemon's ack deadline** — both numbers live together in `HolderInputTiming`,
because a hold longer than the deadline would have the daemon write every held
injection directly while the paste was still open, which is the precise harm
the hold exists to prevent, made systematic rather than rare. A paste that
never closes therefore ends with the injection written into it rather than held
forever: absorbed into the person's paste is visible and recoverable, an
injection nobody can get out is not.

An injection is one message. The caller composes everything the send means —
envelope, body, and the carriage return that submits it — and hands it over
whole, so a payload is never split across a routing decision, and the
per-terminal send serializer upstream keeps two callers' messages apart.

Two writers is a shape worth removing rather than arbitrating, and the design
that removes it — every injection written by the session's own holder, from the
loop that owns the master, with the viewer reduced to a paste lease and a
keystroke hold — is specified in
[`2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md`](2026-09-03-single-typist-injection-design.md).
**That is the target design, not the mechanism described above.** Until it
lands, routing by attach state is what runs, and the ack deadline is what
licenses a second writer.

Resize follows the reader: whichever process currently reads the master owns
`TIOCSWINSZ` — the app drives it from the view while attached, the daemon
holds the last-known size while detached.

## Detached output and the headless emulator

While no viewer is attached, the daemon drains each session's master into a
headless instance of SwiftTerm's core `Terminal` — the same parser the viewer
uses, so the detached picture and the attached picture can never disagree on
interpretation, and every escape-sequence fix benefits both. This repo's own
history is the argument against a purpose-built minimal parser: the
`ANSIEscape` component missed `CSI <>=`, `ESC 7/8`, and charset switching,
and a `hasPrefix` broke title parsing — the escape-sequence long tail is
precisely what bites.

The emulator keeps a bounded in-memory scrollback — 5,000 lines, a plain
constant (`HolderReader.scrollbackLines`), not a flag — and is **not persisted
to disk**. The constant is a memory decision as much as a history one, and the
cost follows from SwiftTerm's cell layout rather than from a measurement.

**Storage is 8 bytes per cell.** A `BufferLine` holds a `CellStoragePage`
(`BufferLine.swift:122`), which owns the row's cells as an
`UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<PackedCell>` (`CellStorage.swift:811`), and a
`PackedCell` is a single `UInt64` (`CellStorage.swift:16,31`) packing the
content tag, the codepoint or grapheme id, a 16-bit style id, the width state
and a payload id. Everything variable-sized lives in a `CellArena`
(`CellStorage.swift:284`) shared by every line of one terminal, which interns
each distinct attribute and grapheme **once** rather than per cell — so a
heavily coloured screen costs the same per cell as a plain one. `CharData` is
the read-side interface the arena expands a cell into, not what is stored;
sizing the budget against it would overstate a session by several times.

So a line is `columns × 8` bytes, a fully materialized 120-column 5,000-line
scrollback is `5,000 × 120 × 8 ≈ 4.8 MB` of cell bytes — call it 5–6 MB with
the per-line `BufferLine` and `CellStoragePage` objects — and the design
point's ~150 resident emulators come to roughly 0.8 GB in the worst case.

That worst case is a ceiling, not an expectation, for two reasons:

- **Lines are materialized lazily.** The buffer preallocates a
  `[BufferLine?]` of `scrollback + rows` slots — around 40 KB of pointers —
  and fills a slot only when a line is written, so a session that has printed
  a screenful costs a screenful.
- **Reaching it takes a filled scrollback.** It needs 5,000 lines of
  120-column output that nothing has scrolled past; an agent session that goes
  quiet holds what it printed and no more.

The limit and the representation both remain open: if field memory pressure
says so, the constant comes down or the per-cell representation changes, and
nothing else in the design depends on either.

A daemon restart starts the emulator empty; the jiggle on re-adoption makes
full-screen programs repaint into the fresh emulator, and the durable record
of an agent's work is its transcript, which persists on disk independently of
any terminal. That heal is scoped honestly: it works for programs that
repaint on SIGWINCH. A plain shell prompt, or output that has scrolled away,
repaints nothing — so after a daemon restart such a *detached* session reads,
and later seeds its viewer, as a blank screen until new output arrives, and a
shell has no transcript to fall back on. tmux preserves screen and history
across daemon restarts unconditionally; this design deliberately does not,
trading that for a daemon that is free to restart under live sessions at all.

Rendering terminal state as bytes is a named deliverable of this design, not
an assumed primitive: both the attach-time snapshot preamble and the app's
pull snapshot need a grid-to-escape-stream serializer (screen plus retained
scrollback, emitted as a stream a fresh emulator ingests). It is exercised on
every attach, so it cannot rot unnoticed the way failure-edge-only code does.

### Two stores, reconciled on demand

While a viewer is attached the daemon reads nothing, so its emulator is
frozen for the duration of that attach — and re-seeded from the app's
handback snapshot on an orderly detach. This design accepts that — the
**two-store model** — rather than having the app stream a copy of everything
it reads back to the daemon:

- The app's SwiftTerm is authoritative while attached; the daemon's emulator
  is authoritative while detached.
- When the daemon needs an attached session's screen (supervision, `tbd
  terminal read`), it **pulls a snapshot from the app** over the existing
  RPC; the app serializes its live terminal state on request. A machine read
  therefore reaches whichever store is live, instead of a store that stopped
  being updated at attach. That is a routing guarantee, not a freshness
  guarantee: when the pull cannot be answered, the consumer's declared policy
  below decides, and one of the two policies deliberately returns a stale
  answer.
- The handback is the orderly path only. An app that dies attached hands back
  nothing, so the daemon reverts to an emulator frozen at that attach and
  heals it with the jiggle alone — which repairs programs that repaint on
  SIGWINCH and nothing else. Same scoping as the daemon-restart case above,
  and for the same reason.
- Pulls are bounded (timeout on an injected clock), and every consumer
  declares a failure policy, because the app can legitimately go quiet —
  macOS App Nap coalesces a backgrounded app's work, and an app being wedged
  or busy correlates with exactly the moments supervision most wants a
  screen, so "quiet" is not the rare case it looks like.
  Safety-critical consumers fail closed: the hibernation pending-input rail
  acts only on a screen the daemon rendered live, and its refusals are set out
  under "Feature parity" below. Best-effort consumers fall back to the
  daemon's frozen-at-attach emulator, labeled stale, rather than blocking on
  an unresponsive app.
- Terminal scrollback history has a hole across each attached period (minus
  whatever the kernel buffer held at the edges). This is the accepted cost,
  and it is cheap here specifically: the artifact users actually mine history
  from is the transcript, and the dominant workload is a full-screen TUI that
  manages its own display anyway.

The alternative — the app forwarding every chunk it reads to the daemon so
one unbroken history exists — was rejected because it re-imposes roughly the
tmux parse-everything CPU bill on the loaded machine this design targets
(relocated off the paint path, but standing), to buy a property (gapless
terminal scrollback) that transcripts already provide where it matters. See
Rejected alternatives.

### The jiggle

Whenever the reader changes — attach, detach, app death, daemon re-adoption —
the incoming reader briefly wiggles the tty size (grow one column, restore)
to force a SIGWINCH, so full-screen programs repaint into the reader's
emulator. This is iTerm2's `WinSizeController` jiggle, applied here at every
handoff edge. iTerm2 reaches it from orphan adoption but **not** from its
ordinary reattach path, and its size-setting is suppressed at two layers when
the requested geometry already matches — so a same-geometry reattach there
issues no ioctl, delivers no SIGWINCH, and heals nothing. Wiring it to every
edge is therefore a deliberate divergence from a proven mechanism, not an
invention. (The jiggle in iTerm2 also fires from two paths unrelated to
attachment — a default-off Clear Buffer setting and a light/dark-change
workaround — so it is not purely a recovery device. Citations for all of this
in the companion iTerm2 record's "Forcing a repaint after reattach" section.) The jiggle heals screen *state*; it cannot
recover missing history and does nothing for scrolled-away output, which is
why it complements rather than replaces the daemon's emulator.

## Feature parity

Everything TBD does through tmux today, and its replacement:

- **Session persistence across app and daemon restarts** — the holder; strictly
  better than today, since attached sessions now also survive daemon restarts
  without interruption.
- **Reattach shows the last screen** — snapshot preamble from the daemon's
  emulator, plus jiggle; scoped by the emulator's lifetime — after a daemon
  restart, a detached session that does not repaint on SIGWINCH (a plain
  shell, scrolled-away output) seeds blank until new output arrives.
- **Input injection** (`tbd terminal send`, queued prompts) — the daemon is the
  sole injector, writing through the session's holder whether or not a viewer is
  attached.
- **Machine reads** (`tbd terminal read`, the interactive-login driver, the
  hibernation pending-input rail, the embedded supervision babysitter) — the
  daemon renders its own emulator when it is the reader and pulls a snapshot
  from the app when a viewer is attached. Every such read answers with a
  typed screen that names which store answered and how stale it is, so a
  consumer can hold a policy rather than a hope
  ([`2026-09-05-child-as-contract-party-design.md`](2026-09-05-child-as-contract-party-design.md)).
  This replaces `capture-pane` with a first-party interface, which the
  no-TUI-scraping rule already pushes toward; the three sanctioned scrapers
  migrate onto it as part of this work.
- **Hibernation and revive** — hibernate instructs the holder to terminate its
  child (the holder reports status and exits); revive spawns a fresh holder.
  The queued-prompt flag keeps its semantics, now gating daemon writes to the
  master instead of tmux `send-keys`. The **input veto does not carry over**:
  its fact source is the app's keystroke stream, and on this transport those
  keystrokes go straight down the pty the viewer holds — which is exactly the
  state a park refuses anyway — so the veto is vacuous for a holder row and
  the screen rail below is the pending-input rail there. Recording the
  daemon's own writes in its place would be strictly worse than recording
  nothing: an auto-resume or a peer's `terminal.send` would then read as
  unsent typed input forever against the merge rail's
  `activityStateObservedAt` anchor, vetoing every park of that row. Three
  properties of the park are load-bearing rather than incidental:

  - **The row never finalizes parked while the child is still running.** The
    park writes its intent, ends the child, confirms the exit, and only then
    finalizes and clears the row's holder and child pids. A child that survives
    both the polite `/exit` and the escalation rolls the intent back and leaves
    the session awake, because a row that claims parked over a live process is
    reclaimable by nothing: no sweep reads it, and a wake would put a second
    agent on the same session.
  - **The park escalates in rungs, and each rung is identity-checked.** An
    in-band `/exit`, then `SIGTERM` to the child pid alone, then telling the
    holder to forget the pty and killing the job by process group — each with
    its own bounded window, so a session whose Stop hooks and MCP teardown
    outlast the polite one still gets to shut itself down rather than being
    killed mid-write. Before any signal the recorded pid is verified as this
    session's own child, the way every other signalling site in the daemon
    verifies one; an identity that cannot be established signals nothing, lets
    the holder go without a kill, and leaves the row awake for a reconciler to
    judge.
  - **The pending-input rail acts only on a screen the daemon rendered live.**
    It reads the typed screen the machine-read contract answers with and
    branches on that answer's `source`. A `daemon` screen is judged for a
    half-composed prompt; every other answer is refused, each by a name of its
    own, because the remedies differ — a `staleDaemon` or `viewer` screen
    means somebody has the session open and the tab is what to close, a
    session with no reader is one the daemon has lost track of, and a screen
    that will not project is a defect to fix. A live `daemon` screen is also
    refused, by a name of its own, when its emulator did not observe the child
    from that child's start — the re-adoption case the screen carries as
    `contentObserved`: such an emulator inherited a blank grid under a child
    that repaints only what it is changing, so its screen can show a phantom
    composer where the session is idle and a blank one where somebody is
    typing. Refusing is recoverable; eating a half-composed prompt is not. The
    idle sweep asks the same question before it arms a row, reading those two
    facts alone rather than paying for the lines, so a session the park could
    never complete costs no request-and-refusal pair on every pass.
  - **Revive re-anchors the identity check.** The row records when its current
    child started, because a woken session's child is younger than its row and
    every reclaimer that verifies a recorded pid against a start time would
    otherwise read it as a stranger.

  Park and wake on this transport carry no switch of their own. Holder-ness is
  a transport property, not a separate opt-in: the idle sweep arms a holder row
  on the same `auto_hibernate_enabled` that arms a tmux row, manual "Hibernate
  now" is unflagged on every transport exactly as it always has been on tmux,
  the merge-triggered park rides the same per-worktree tri-state and
  `auto_hibernate_on_merge_default`, and the reconcile arm parks a finished
  resumable holder row exactly as it parks a tmux one — a park is worth having
  because every transport has a wake path.

  An unparked holder row asked to wake is classified against the process table
  rather than against a tmux pane, because a holder row's pane id is the empty
  string by construction and tmux answers for it by reporting the pane gone.
  The startup arm that heals parked holder rows runs on every pass: both of its
  verdicts are safety-only — one un-parks a row over a child that is verifiably
  alive, the other clears pids that verifiably name nothing.

  The **limit-resume rail**, which types "continue" into a session whose usage
  limit has reset, is served on this transport rather than refused, and gates
  on exactly what gates it on tmux and nothing more. On this transport it writes through
  `HolderInjectionCourier` rather than tmux `send-keys`, in the tmux sequence's
  own shape and timing: one write of `ESC`, the same 150 ms pause, then one
  write of the literal and its carriage return. The Escape needs a read of its
  own because an ink-style input parser reads `ESC` followed immediately by a
  printable byte as a meta key, so a single combined write would compose Alt-c
  and then "ontinue" on every attempt. The second write keeps its `\r` — nine
  bytes, under the size at which an unwrapped write loses its trailing `\r`, so
  no bracketed-paste wrapper is needed. Its pane-identity, pane-PID and
  copy-mode rails are tmux's alone and are skipped; the verification that
  follows the send reads hook-fed activity state and transcript growth, so it
  is the same code for both transports. A rail that resumes a session is the
  counterpart of one that parks it, so the two are reachable on exactly the
  same terms: a fleet where an auto-resume could fire at a session no sweep may
  park is the state this avoids.
- **Scrollback** — bounded emulator history while detached, SwiftTerm's own
  history while attached, transcripts as the durable record. tmux's 50k-line
  retention is not matched and deliberately so.

### Out of scope, structurally

- **External attach from another terminal emulator** is not carried forward.
  It existed only as a diagnostic and has been removed independently of
  this design.
- **Remote or ssh attach** cannot exist in this design: the interface is a
  file descriptor, and a file descriptor cannot cross a machine boundary.
  Every system in the survey that dropped a mux server also dropped this, on
  purpose. If remote viewing is ever wanted it is a separate streaming
  feature, not a holder feature. Sessions on remote hosts keep whatever
  transport they have today; this migration is local-machine only.
- **Survival of reboot or GUI logout** — not provided, exactly as today.

## Reconciliation

Per the named-reconciler doctrine, the new durable resources are the holder
processes, their socket and lock files, and (transitively) the agent processes
under them. Orphans can arise because holder creation is non-transactional against
the process table — the same argument as every other resource here.

- **`WorktreeLifecycle+Reconcile`** swaps its ground truth from tmux windows
  and servers to the **holder inventory**: enumerate holder sockets under the
  sessions directory, connect, and handshake (yielding holder pid, child pid,
  child status, and launch parameters). A session row with no live holder is
  marked exited through the existing handling — and specifically as **status
  unknown**, never a fabricated `0`. This is the durable landing place for the
  case the holder's Lifetime contract describes: a daemon that was down through
  the holder's whole report timeout comes back to a vanished holder and an
  unreported status, and the sweep must record the absence rather than invent
  a value. A **rejected** connection is
  the opposite of a dead holder — the holder is alive and owned by another
  daemon (a stale daemon from a different checkout is a known hazard on a
  development machine) — and must never feed the exited path. **A rejected
  connection is terminal for this sweep in both directions**: not exited, and
  not killed either — a holder that will not talk to us is left alone and
  logged, never reclaimed on the theory that it has no row.

  **A completed handshake is proof of liveness, not of ownership**, and only
  ownership licenses a kill. Two installations can share a holders directory —
  the default `TBD_HOME` is shared by every checkout on a machine — so
  "reachable and absent from *my* database" is exactly the shape a foreign but
  perfectly healthy session presents. The holder therefore carries an **owner
  token**, given at spawn and returned by every handshake: a UUID minted once
  per installation and persisted in the `config` row. It identifies the
  installation rather than the process, so it survives daemon restarts — a
  token that did not would strand a daemon from reclaiming the holders it
  spawned a moment earlier, which is the common case, not the exotic one. The
  sweep kills only a holder whose token matches its own; a mismatch is left
  alone and logged, exactly like a rejection. Only a holder that handshakes,
  proves the same owner, and still has no session row is a half-finished
  deletion, and that is the case where the daemon kills the child and the
  holder.

  **Row-lessness is only meaningful once creation can no longer be in flight.**
  Reconcile runs on demand from RPC handlers, not only at startup, so it can
  land in the window between a holder becoming connectable and its session row
  committing — and killing there would destroy a session that was merely being
  born. Two things close that window, and both are required. Creation **commits
  the session row before the holder becomes discoverable**: the row is written
  in a creating state first, and only then is the holder spawned, so a
  discoverable holder always has a row unless something failed. And the sweep
  is **keep-biased for young holders** — a holder whose socket is newer than a
  grace window is left alone regardless of row state, the same guard `OrphanGC`
  already applies to the same race shape. Ordering alone would be enough if
  nothing ever crashed between the two steps; the grace window is what makes
  the guarantee hold when something does.
  **Kill, not adopt** — iTerm2 adopts unclaimed survivors into new tabs
  because its live processes are the only copy of anything; TBD's transcripts
  persist independently, so adoption would buy a mystery-session UI and
  little else, and it cuts against the database-is-intent model the other
  reconcilers already follow.
- **`OrphanGC`** (hourly, gated on `gcEnabled` as today) gains two sweeps:
  unlink socket files (and their sibling lock files) with no listening
  process behind them, and re-run the holder-versus-database check between
  startup reconciles. The socket sweep is mandatory, not hygienic: a
  SIGKILLed holder cannot unlink its own socket, and the tmux precedent on
  this machine was ~7,100 dead socket files, because tmux unlinks lazily on
  rebind and nothing ever rebound. The lock file leaks only as an empty
  file — the kernel released its lock when the holder died — so it is swept
  for tidiness on the same pass rather than needing its own reclaimer.
- **`AgentReaper`** gains a holder-transport leg. Its existing sweep
  enumerates children of tmux server pids and structurally cannot see a
  child re-parented to launchd, so for holder-transport sessions it sweeps by
  each session's **recorded child pid** (captured at spawn and refreshed at
  adoption), verifying process identity (executable and start time) before
  killing, and reaps children whose session row is exited or absent. This is
  the backstop for holder deaths the daemon was down for; the prompt path is
  the daemon's own holder-connection watch ("Holder death" above).

### Letting go of a finished session's reader

The reconcilers above reclaim things that outlive the daemon. A `HolderReader`
does not, and it is expensive all the same: a dedicated thread with a 1 MB
stack, a 64 KB read buffer, an emulator holding thousands of lines of
scrollback, and a dup of the pty master. After end of file its drain thread
parks on its wake pipe rather than exiting — deliberately, so the descriptor's
close stays on the stop path where no `write` can race a reused fd number — so
nothing but an explicit release unwinds any of it. Without one the daemon's
memory tracks sessions **adopted since it started** rather than sessions alive,
and a long-lived daemon on a busy fleet grows without bound.

**Release takes two conditions, and both are load-bearing.**

- **The drain has reached the end of the session's output.** A holder hands its
  master over even after its child has exited, precisely so the bytes the job
  wrote and nobody read can still be drained; releasing on the exit alone would
  throw away exactly what that rule rescues. The exhausted edge — the drain read
  until the descriptor would block and then classified it as done — is the proof
  that nothing is left queued.
- **The holder says the child exited.** End of file means the last slave closed,
  which is nearly always the job exiting — but a job is entitled to close its
  terminal and keep running, and its session row is still live. So the holder is
  asked over a fresh connection, and a child it still reports as alive keeps its
  reader.

The second condition is only a condition if it takes an **answer**. A probe that
merely failed collapses the pair back to the first, which is the shape that
discards a live session's scrollback — so the ruling on a failed probe is where
the policy is actually decided.

**Only positive evidence licenses a release**, because the two errors are not
symmetric. A reader kept in error costs one emulator until its session row is
closed or the daemon restarts; a reader released in error stops the drain
thread, closes the pty dup and drops everything the session ever printed, for
good. Each way a round trip can fail is therefore classified by name:

- **A refusal** — the holder answered with the busy sentinel — is a *live*
  holder serving somebody else. Evidence of liveness, explicitly not of exit,
  and the same reading the row-less sweep and startup adoption both take. Keeps.
- **Nothing listening at the rendezvous** — `ENOENT` or `ECONNREFUSED` on the
  connect — is the one failure that establishes something: the holder process is
  gone. Those two errnos are the only ones that mean absence rather than this
  daemon failing to reach a socket, and they are read that way in two other
  places already, which must not disagree. It is *established* rather than
  retried because absence is monotone here: the session's holder provably bound
  the path once, since a hand-over came over it, and a holder that has gone does
  not come back. Recorded as **status unknown**, never a fabricated code, the
  same convention startup adoption uses for the same observation.
- **Any other connect failure** — an interrupted syscall, descriptor exhaustion,
  buffer pressure, a connect timeout — describes this daemon's own attempt and
  says nothing whatever about the child. Retried.
- **A round trip that reached the socket and then failed** — a hang-up between
  the accept and the answer, a broken pipe, a connection reset, the receive
  timeout expiring — is what a holder winding down looks like, and equally what
  one killed mid-frame looks like. Which of the two arrives is decided by
  microseconds, so neither may reach a different conclusion. Retried.
- **An answer that is not the description asked for** is retried, because the
  client's frame queue can carry an unsolicited push that crossed the wire with
  somebody else's answer. A disagreement that persists is a reason to stop
  trusting the answer, never a reason to believe the job is dead.
- **Everything else** — a path too long for `sun_path`, a case structurally
  unreachable from this call, anything a future client throws — keeps. The
  fall-through is the conservative direction by construction.

A session whose holder stays reachable but never answers is therefore kept
indefinitely, and that is the intended trade: the cost is one emulator, ended by
the session's own teardown or by a daemon restart, against the permanent loss of
a live session's screen.

**The constants.** The probe retries on a **2-second budget** at a **50 ms
interval**. End of file on the master and the holder's `waitpid` are two
observations of one event made by two processes — the slave closes as the job's
descriptors are released, and the holder learns of the exit on its next poll
slice — so the first ask can legitimately answer "alive", and a reclaimer that
gave up on that would keep every reader forever. The budget is comfortably
longer than the holder's 50 ms poll slice, and finite next to the ten-second
window a holder keeps its rendezvous bound after its child dies; the interval
matches that poll slice, so a retry costs one connect per slice rather than
spinning. The same budget covers the retried failures above: they are asking the
same question, and giving them a second budget would only be a second number to
get wrong.

**The lifecycle is a weak closure, and that is not a formality.** The reader
announces its exhausted edge on a callback the registry supplies, which captures
the registry weakly and hops onto a task. Weakly, because the registry owns the
reader: a strong capture would be a cycle keeping every reader — and its thread,
its emulator and its pty dup — alive for as long as the process runs, which is
the leak this whole mechanism exists to close. Onto a task, because the callback
runs on the drain thread, and a release driven inline would be waiting on the
very thread it is running on. The announcement fires **once**, on the
transition: a second one would ask the registry to reclaim what it has already
reclaimed, and the slot it names may by then belong to a different reader.

**This is not an `AgentReaper` leg, and not a sweep at all.** The named-reconciler
doctrine asks who reclaims the orphans of a *durable* resource — one the external
world commits to before TBD records the intent, which survives a crash with
nobody owning it. A reader is the opposite: it lives only in the memory of the
daemon that made it, and a daemon that dies takes every reader with it, so there
is no orphan for a sweep to find. What is left behind on that path is the
holder, the job and the rendezvous files, and those already have their
reconcilers above. A periodic sweep would also be strictly worse at the job: the
only safe moment to let go is the exhausted edge, which is an edge rather than a
state a sweep could sample, and asking every session's holder on a timer would
put a fleet's worth of round trips per interval against holders that wind down
when they answer.

## Rollout

This wholesale-replaces a load-bearing path, so it ships behind a default-off
flag with a soak and a stated graduation plan.

- **Flag.** `pty_holder_enabled`, a `config` column added by a `.sql`
  migration with **no SQL `DEFAULT` clause**, so unset stays a third state.
  The shipped default is `false`, resolved in `ConfigRecord.toModel(...)` the
  way the **graduation-ready** gates there resolve theirs: a
  `ptyHolderDefault: Bool = Config.ptyHolderDefault` parameter on `toModel`,
  and `pty_holder_enabled ?? ptyHolderDefault` in the body. That is a minority
  of the gates in that file, not all of them — roughly seven follow it, while
  a dozen older ones still hardcode `?? false` or `?? true`. Those older gates
  are the ones CLAUDE.md describes as not retrofittable, because their columns
  shipped with a SQL `DEFAULT` that backfilled every existing row and destroyed
  the distinction between "chose off" and "never chose". The convention here is
  the one to copy precisely because the file is not uniform. The injected
  parameter is not decoration — it is what lets a test change the effective
  default and prove NULL follows it while an explicit `0` does not. Tests cover
  all three states: a pre-migration row reads NULL rather than `0`, NULL
  follows the injected default, and an explicit `0` survives a change to it.
- **Granularity: spawn time only.** A session records its transport (`tmux`
  or `holder`) in its database row at creation and keeps it for life; the app
  attaches by whichever transport the row names. Flipping the flag never
  migrates a running session — the fleet converges as sessions naturally end
  and respawn. Live migration (extracting a pty from a running tmux server)
  is rejected; see below.

  The sessions the flag reaches ask it through one gate
  (`TerminalSpawnTransport.decide`) and spawn through one function
  (`WorktreeLifecycle.spawnTerminal`): the primary terminal at worktree
  creation, the setup and pre-session hook tabs, restored archived sessions,
  revive-from-history tabs, fork-session tabs, and the extra terminals
  `terminal.create` and `terminal.continueInCodex` open — Claude, Codex and
  shell alike, since the holder runs any command. A wake respawns onto the
  transport its row recorded. The one spawn kind pinned to tmux whatever the
  flag says is the profile login tab, because its auto-`/login` pump reads and
  types through a tmux pane. It spawns through the same function with the
  transport pinned, so the flag reaching it later is a one-line change at that
  site rather than a second spawn implementation.

  The flag therefore gates **spawning, not servicing**: the flag is consulted
  only when a session is created, and both transports' machinery (attach
  paths, the daemon's arbitration and drain, each reconciler's ground-truth
  sweep) runs whenever any session row of that transport exists, regardless
  of the flag's current value. Toggling in either direction strands nothing:
  off → on leaves every running tmux session on tmux and routes only new
  spawns to holders; on → off leaves every running holder session on its
  holder and routes new spawns back to tmux.
- **No per-leg switches.** Hibernation, orphan GC, the reaper and the
  reconcile pass each have a holder leg, and each leg derives its gate from
  the subsystem it belongs to: `auto_hibernate_enabled` for the idle sweep,
  `gc_enabled` for the two GC arms, nothing for the reaper and reconcile legs,
  which their tmux counterparts also run without. Holder-ness is a transport
  property, not a second opt-in; the rule and its consequences are in
  [`2026-09-07-holder-flag-consolidation-design.md`](2026-09-07-holder-flag-consolidation-design.md).
- **Coexistence cost, stated honestly.** Both paths live until graduation:
  two reconciliation ground truths, a doubled test surface, and — counted
  accurately — a **third** attach path in the app, not a second. The app
  already carries two: the older one forks a `tmux attach` client per viewer
  and lets SwiftTerm read that client's pty, and the control-mode one feeds
  SwiftTerm bytes the daemon relays over the FD sidecar. The holder path joins
  them. That the count is three is an argument for graduating and deleting
  promptly, not against the design — and the control-mode path's fd-in,
  `feed(byteArray:)`-out shape is the closest existing seam to what the holder
  transport needs, so the third path is cheaper than the second was. Each
  gated branch gets tests for flag-on and flag-off behavior.
- **Soak.** Enable on a development machine running a real fleet at real
  load. Ordinary development restarts exercise the re-adoption path
  continuously — the hardest code in the design gets adversarial testing for
  free. Graduation gates on field evidence: no double-reader violations, the
  reconcilers holding (no growth in unclaimed holders or socket litter), and
  latency flatness re-confirmed under load by re-running the probes that drew
  the curve in the first place: `scripts/diag/tmux-vs-rawpty-idle.py` for the
  raw-versus-tmux echo comparison and `scripts/diag/tmux-server-contention.py`
  for the pane-count control. Both are committed alongside this design, for
  the reason that a design justified by a latency curve has to ship the tool
  that can re-draw it — otherwise graduation is a judgement call wearing a
  measurement's clothes.

  **Flatness is the claim, so flatness is what the threshold has to test.** An
  absolute latency bound alone would pass a transport that is merely fast on a
  quiet machine, which is exactly what tmux already is — its p50 is 1.1 ms and
  imperceptible. The graduation run is therefore a paired measurement, and all
  four conditions must hold:

  - **Workload:** the design point as stated above — **~150 concurrent sessions
    at sustained load ≥ 100** on one machine, matched against an idle-machine
    run of the same probe, interleaved so both arms see the same conditions.
    Session count and load are two different numbers and both have to be met;
    validating at 100 sessions would clear a materially lower bar than the
    design targets.
  - **Sample:** at least 2,000 keystrokes per arm. This is a bar chosen for
    graduation, **not** a repeat of the original method: the load-based latency
    runs behind the headline numbers were small, and their highest-load bucket
    was explicitly n=4 and directional only. That is precisely why graduation
    needs a larger sample than the measurements that motivated it — a p90 is
    the statistic under test, and a p90 from a handful of samples is not one.
  - **Absolute bound:** p90 keystroke echo at load stays at or under **5 ms**,
    the ceiling a raw pty was never observed to exceed at any load up to 117.
  - **Flatness bound:** p90 at load is no more than **2×** p90 at idle. The
    multiplier is set where it is because it has to sit clear of ordinary
    scheduling jitter on a loaded machine while still failing anything with a
    per-keystroke wakeup in the path — and tmux fails it by more than an order
    of magnitude, so the exact value is not load-bearing. Its p90 went
    9.3 → 12.7 → 139 ms as load rose; the 139 ms bucket is n=4 and directional
    only, but even discarding it entirely the 9.3 → 12.7 growth already
    exceeds nothing-should-grow, and the mechanism is not in doubt: a tmux
    keystroke costs process wakeups whose latency is scheduling delay.

  Any load-dependent growth beyond that flatness bound means the transport has
  a wakeup in the echo path that the design says it does not, and graduation
  does not proceed on the theory that the absolute number still looks small.

  **The run must exercise a real holder-backed session, not the raw-pty arm
  standing in for one.** The existing probes measure a raw pty and tmux; the
  raw arm is *expected* to be the holder's attached echo path exactly, because
  by construction there is no process between the app and the master once a
  viewer is attached — the holder never reads, and the daemon has stepped off.
  But that is the design's central claim, and a graduation gate that assumes it
  is measuring nothing. So the load arm runs against sessions actually spawned
  on the holder transport with a viewer attached, and the raw-pty arm stays as
  the reference the holder path is expected to match: if the two diverge, the
  gap is a process in the path that should not be there, and finding it is the
  entire value of the measurement. The detached path is a separate question the
  flatness bound does not speak to at all — nobody is typing into a detached
  session — and the reconciler and drain evidence cover it instead.

  **"No double-reader violations" is only evidence if something can see one.**
  A double read is silent by construction — each `read()` takes bytes the other
  reader never sees — so an absence of reports is not an absence of the fault,
  and gating the design's central safety property on unaided observation would
  be the weakest step in the argument. Two positive detectors carry that bar
  instead. An always-on **reader-count assertion**: the daemon holds explicit
  per-session reader state, and every transition into reading asserts the count
  was zero, incrementing a violation counter and logging loudly rather than
  trusting the arbitration to be correct. And a soak-time **continuity
  canary**: a known sequence written periodically to a session, whose reader
  checks it arrives unbroken — a gap is byte theft, positively observed rather
  than inferred. Graduation reads those two numbers.
- **Graduation.** Flip `Config.ptyHolderDefault` to `true` — a one-line
  change that reaches everyone who never chose while preserving every
  explicit opt-out. That is the transport's only graduation event: its holder
  legs in hibernation, orphan GC, the reaper and the reconcile pass carry no
  switch of their own and so have nothing to graduate. Removing the tmux path
  entirely is separate, later work, undertaken once no `tmux`-transport
  session rows remain in the wild.

New delays introduced by this design — the re-adoption grace window, the
holder's exit-report timeout, any handoff ack timeout — take an injected
clock (`clock: any Clock<Duration> = ContinuousClock()`), per the repo rule.

## Relationship to the build-isolation work

Issue #720 (isolating development builds from the production daemon, tmux
server, and database) interacts with this design in both directions: it
reduces how often the production daemon restarts, shrinking one window the
holder covers, while the holder makes daemon restarts nearly free for live
sessions, shrinking the pain that motivates it. The two are deliberately
**independent, with no ordering dependency**: whichever lands first makes the
other somewhat less urgent, nothing in either design assumes the other, and
re-scoping #720 is that issue's own decision, not this spec's.

## Learnings from iTerm2

iTerm2 is the shipping precedent for the core of this design, and its source
is a catalogue of paid-for lessons. **Implementers and reviewers of this work
should read the companion record
[`iterm2-session-restoration.md`](../research/2026-08-30-terminal-session-persistence/iterm2-session-restoration.md)
and consult the iTerm2 source before re-deriving any of the following**, each
of which is carried into this design:

- **The fd rides on a one-byte `sendmsg`.** `sendmsg` with an `SCM_RIGHTS`
  control block has been observed failing with `EMSGSIZE` at payload sizes
  the man page permits, and an empty payload fails too; iTerm2 caps the
  fd-carrying message at exactly one byte and sends the rest with a plain
  `write()` — and never re-sends the fd on a short write, or the recipient
  materializes duplicate descriptors. TBD's existing FD sidecar already
  navigates fd-number recycling; the holder protocol adopts the one-byte
  convention as well.
- **Reads on the fd channel must be serialized by construction** — exactly
  one method may read after the handshake, or interleaved partial reads
  corrupt the stream.
- **Creation races are settled by an advisory lock file** held for the
  server's whole life — adopted verbatim, and specified under "Creation is
  serialized by an advisory lock" above. Connecting to a *busy* server is a
  separate problem with a separate answer: accept-then-reject with a sentinel
  version.
- **SIGHUP is not enough on user-initiated close.** A supervised child can
  ignore SIGHUP, leaving the supervisor alive to be adopted later; closing a
  session must make the holder forget the child (close the master, stop
  reporting) and then kill, which is why the protocol carries a forget verb.
- **`sun_path` shapes the feature.** Check the socket path length before
  every bind and connect; keep the rendezvous directory shallow.
- **`setsid()` in the supervisor is load-bearing**, and SIGHUP/SIGPIPE must
  be ignored, or a crash of the spawning process (or a `sendmsg` into a dead
  peer) takes the supervisor with it.
- **The jiggle exists and works** — and iTerm2 reaches it from orphan
  adoption but not from its ordinary reattach path, leaving that common path
  unhealed behind two layers of same-size suppression. This design applies it
  at every reader
  handoff.
- **Content and process persist on different clocks** unless something keeps
  the detached picture current. iTerm2 saves screen contents only on losing
  focus and at clean quit, so a crash restores a screen as stale as the last
  click away, with no banner admitting it. The daemon's always-on drain is
  this design's answer; the residual skew (the attached-period scrollback
  hole) is accepted and documented above.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Keeping tmux and sharding servers more finely.** Rejected on mechanism,
  not on measurement: the cost of tmux is per-keystroke process wakeups, and
  every server has those no matter how few panes it holds — so sharding
  redistributes panes without removing a single wakeup. The supporting
  measurement (a busy server against a private one-pane server, 34.1 vs
  36.5 ms p50 under load) is **weaker than it looks and should not be leaned
  on**: `tmux-server-contention.py` forks a `tmux send-keys` client per
  sample, so both arms carry a fork+exec that dominates the reading — which is
  why those numbers sit ~30× above the 1.1 ms p50 the fork-avoiding method
  measures for quiet tmux. Both arms share the method, so a large difference
  would still have surfaced; but at that resolution the run cannot rule out a
  difference of a few milliseconds. It supports "pane count is not a large
  effect", not "pane count is not an effect", and the argument above does not
  need the stronger claim.
- **The daemon holds the masters itself (no holder).** A daemon restart is
  precisely one of the windows persistence exists to cover, and on a
  development machine the daemon restarts constantly. The holder exists to
  make the daemon boring to restart.
- **Per-repo or global holders.** A global holder is a single crash away from
  SIGHUPing the entire fleet and is the one process that can never be
  restarted for an upgrade (the successor-spawn fd-inheritance dance is the
  known workaround, and it is surgery). Per-repo shrinks but keeps both
  problems and adds child-table multiplexing to the protocol. Per-session
  makes blast radius one session and upgrade a non-event.
- **The holder drains its own pty (headless emulator in the holder).** Every
  minimal-supervisor precedent (shpool, zmx, the Zed proposal) puts the
  emulator in the persistent process — but each of those has no other
  persistent process. TBD has an always-on daemon, so putting the emulator
  there keeps the holder near-featureless and makes the crashiest, most
  frequently updated code freely restartable and upgradable. The residual
  window — daemon and app both dead — blocks writers without losing data and
  is bounded by daemon supervision.
- **The app streams attached-period output to the daemon for one unbroken
  history.** Rejected as a standing per-byte tax (roughly tmux's parse bill,
  relocated) on exactly the loaded machine this design targets, purchasing
  gapless terminal scrollback that transcripts already provide where it
  matters. The two-store model with pull-on-demand keeps machine reads
  current at zero steady-state cost.
- **State handback at detach** (the app serializes its full terminal state to
  the daemon when it detaches). Its worst case sits on the worst edge: an
  app crash is a detach with no handback, leaving both a permanent history
  gap and a stale emulator resuming mid-stream, and it requires a full
  SwiftTerm state export/import surface exercised only at failure time.
- **A purpose-built minimal VT parser.** The `ANSIEscape` scar tissue is the
  refutation: the escape-sequence long tail is where the bugs live, and a
  second interpretation of the stream can disagree with the viewer's.
  Likewise **a third-party headless VT** (e.g. libghostty-vt): well-tested,
  but a new dependency and a second interpretation; SwiftTerm headless gives
  one parser for both pictures.
- **Persisting the daemon's emulator to disk.** Buys a cold-restorable
  picture across daemon crashes at the cost of a write cadence, a file
  format, and a new durable resource needing a reclaimer — for a screen the
  jiggle heals and a history the transcript already holds.
- **Live-migrating running sessions between transports at flag flip.**
  Extracting a live pty from a tmux server is ptrace-grade surgery with no
  payoff; sessions converge to the new transport as they naturally recycle.
- **Adopting unclaimed holders into the UI** (iTerm2's orphan adoption).
  TBD's database records intent and its transcripts survive independently; a
  row-less holder is a half-finished deletion, not a treasure, and adoption
  UI is real complexity.
- **Predictive local echo (the mosh approach) instead of removing tmux.**
  Prediction speculates only about the echo of the user's own printable
  keystrokes; it does nothing for program output, scrolling, or a
  full-screen TUI repainting — which is most of what a fleet of streaming
  agents shows. It is a complement to a fast path, not a substitute.
