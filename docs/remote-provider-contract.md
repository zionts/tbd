# Remote agent provider contract (v2)

This document specifies the contract a **provider** must implement to plug a remote agent backend into TBD. A provider is a single executable, registered with TBD, that manages agent sessions running somewhere TBD doesn't otherwise reach — a cloud VM, a container service, a remote SSH host, or similar. TBD owns this contract; providers own everything about how they actually reach and run sessions. This document is normative: an implementation that satisfies it is a valid provider regardless of what transport or vendor APIs it uses internally.

## Overview & invocation model

TBD invokes the provider executable as `<exec> [args...] <verb> [flags]`. Depending on the verb, TBD may pass structured input on stdin and reads either a single JSON object or an NDJSON stream from stdout. stderr is diagnostic only — TBD logs it but never parses it — with exactly one exception: `transcript` returns its continuation cursor as a JSON envelope on stderr, and that envelope is the only stderr content any verb defines (see `transcript` below).

Every invocation carries a contract major in `TBD_CONTRACT_VERSION` (see Versioning below), and the provider inherits the caller's full login environment. On every verb except `describe` this is the negotiated major. `describe` is the call that produces the negotiation, so no negotiated value exists yet when it runs: it carries the **caller's own highest supported major** instead. A provider MUST NOT vary its `describe` response based on that value — `describe` answers from static local data and MUST report every major the provider supports, so that a caller supporting a newer major than the provider still negotiates down correctly rather than being told only what it asked about.

Three verbs are **required**: `describe`, `create`, and `list`. Every other verb is optional and declared as a **capability** via `describe`. A caller MUST NOT invoke a verb whose capability the provider has not declared, and MUST NOT offer a user-facing action that would require one.

## Verb table

## Session object

This is the one shape every verb that returns session data shares:

```json
{
  "id": "fix-flaky-ci",
  "title": "fix flaky CI",
  "created_at": "2026-07-24T18:02:11Z",
  "state": "starting|running|exited",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "agent_state": "working|waiting_input|idle|exited|unknown",
  "agent_state_reason": "permission_prompt",
  "agent_state_at": "2026-07-24T18:40:00Z",
  "archived": false,
  "meta": {"repo": "acme/api", "branch": "fix-ci"}
}
```

Session state is three independent axes:

- **`state`** — terminal/session liveness only (`starting`, `running`, `exited`). It says whether the underlying process, container, or instance is alive; it says nothing about the agent's activity or health.
- **`agent_state`** — "does a human need to look at this" (`working`, `waiting_input`, `idle`, `exited`, `unknown`). **Normative rule: `agent_state` MUST be derived from machine interfaces — agent lifecycle hooks, transcript files, process exit codes — and MUST NEVER be inferred by parsing rendered terminal output.** Screen text is a display surface, not a state API: scraping it breaks silently when rendering changes and produces false signals. A provider with no such instrumentation available MUST report `"unknown"` rather than guess. `state: "running"` with `agent_state: "unknown"` means only that the terminal/session is present and no machine-readable agent state is available; it never means healthy, idle, or finished. If machine-readable instrumentation reports that the agent produced final output and is waiting for another instruction, the provider SHOULD report `"idle"`; without that instrumentation it remains `"unknown"`.
- **`archived`** — whether the session has been retired from the working inventory (`true` or `false`). This is a filing decision, orthogonal to both axes above: a session MAY be archived while its machine is still winding down, and a session MUST NOT become archived implicitly because it exited, went idle, or aged out. Only `archive` and `unarchive` (or an equivalent gesture on the provider's own surface) change it.

Other fields:

- `exit_code` is present if and only if `state` is `"exited"` and the code is known.
- `archived` is optional on the wire; an absent `archived` MUST be read as `false`. What a provider owes when enumerating archived sessions is specified under Archived sessions stay in the inventory below.
- Every field but `id` is optional to a caller in practice, whatever this document requires of a provider: a value of the wrong JSON type is read as though the field were absent, so `state` and `agent_state` fall back to `"unknown"` and the rest simply go unset. Only `id` is load-bearing enough to cost the session, since without it there is no identity to file the session under. This is a caller's degradation rule, not a licence — a provider that emits a wrong-typed field is violating the contract, and TBD records what it dropped in its own diagnostics.
- `meta` is a flat string-to-string map of provider-defined display pairs. The keys `repo`, `branch`, and `profile` are well-known: a caller MAY interpret them (for example, to look up PR status for that repo/branch pair, or to show which identity a session is currently running as) when present — mirroring how `create_params` already designates well-known field names below. Providers are not required to supply `repo`, `branch`, or `profile`, and a caller MUST degrade gracefully when any are absent (falling back to opaque rendering, or simply showing nothing extra). Two further well-known keys, `tbd_worktree_id` and `tbd_parent_worktree_id`, are specified under Worktree identity keys below. Every other key, and any well-known key whenever a caller has no special handling for it, are rendered as opaque detail rows — the caller never interprets arbitrary `meta` keys or values beyond this well-known set. When present, `meta.profile` is the display name of the profile the session is currently running as (a plain string — the profile's `name`, not the full profile object below) — a provider that supports the `profile` and/or `set-profile` capabilities SHOULD keep it current across `create` and any later swap, so any other client of the same backend can see which identity a session runs as without maintaining its own state. The map's values are strings; a value that is not one is a contract violation whose cost stops at its own key. TBD keeps a number or boolean in its literal string form, since a display map can show either unambiguously, and drops an object, an array, or a null, which it cannot. `meta` itself not being an object is the one case that costs more: there are no keys to salvage, so the whole map is lost — including `repo`, which is what resolves the session to a repository, so such a session never gets a worktree row. What TBD never does is fail the session — nor, because a malformed session is skipped rather than fatal to the array that holds it, the rest of the inventory. A session skipped that way is simply absent from that snapshot, and absence is read as the drift rule reads any absence.

The condition worth notifying a human about is an **edge** in `agent_state` — a transition into `waiting_input` or `exited` — not the value in isolation.

### Unclean-checkout key (optional)

One further `meta` key is well-known, on the same terms as the keys above: `workspace_dirty`. A provider that knows the session's checkout carries work which is not committed or not pushed sets it to `"true"`; anything else, including an absent key, means no claim was made. A caller MAY refuse a destructive gesture — retiring the session, say — on a session that claims it, and MUST degrade to its ordinary behavior when the key is absent, since most providers cannot see that fact and none is required to report it. Only `"true"` and `"1"` are read as a claim, trimmed and case-insensitively; a caller MUST NOT read an arbitrary value as one. Optional and purely additive at either contract major, like the identity keys below.

### Worktree identity keys (optional)

Two further `meta` keys are well-known, on the same terms as `repo`, `branch`, and `profile`: `tbd_worktree_id` and `tbd_parent_worktree_id`. They are how a session tells TBD which lane it *is* and which lane spawned it. Both are optional and purely additive — a provider that sets neither is fully conformant and behaves exactly as it does without them — and both are readable at either contract major. They ride inside `meta`, which is a provider-defined map at every major, and a caller with no handling for a key simply renders it as an opaque detail row, so populating them is not a v2 feature and needs no change to a provider's declared `contract_versions`.

TBD reads them when it creates the worktree row that represents the session (**adoption**). A session that resolves to a repository TBD has registered gets exactly one such row; a session that resolves to no registered repository gets none, and neither key changes that. Once the row exists it is never re-derived: with one exception named below, a later value for either key on a later `list` or `events` sighting is ignored, because the row's identity and its position in the tree are the user's to change from that point on. TBD never renames a row, rewrites its branch, rebinds its identifier, or moves a row that already sits somewhere, on the strength of a later sighting.

The exception is the nesting edge, and only in one direction: **a row that has no parent may take one from a later sighting; a row that has one keeps it.** Filling an empty edge overwrites no decision — the parent was simply not knowable when the row was minted, because the session had not been stamped yet or the spawning lane was not yet a row TBD had. Refusing it would strand that lane at top level permanently, since adoption finds the row already bound on every later sighting. Changing an edge that already exists is a different act, and TBD does not do it: once a lane is visible in the tree, where it sits is the user's.

- **`tbd_worktree_id`** — the session's own lane identity, as a UUID string. A provider never discovers this value; it can only be told. The caller mints the identifier for the row that will represent the session and supplies it when it creates the session, and exporting it into that session's environment as `TBD_WORKTREE_ID` — which is what lets an agent running inside the session use TBD verbs keyed on ambient identity — is then the provider's obligation, since the provider alone controls that environment. The `create` stdin field that carries the identifier is not yet part of this document, so a provider that has been told nothing has nothing to echo and correctly omits the key. A provider that does know the value SHOULD echo it here, because the echo is what makes the binding self-healing: if TBD loses the row after the session is already running, echoing the id lets TBD recreate the row under the same identity rather than minting a second one and stranding the variable the session already exported.
  - **Absent** – TBD mints a fresh identifier for the row. Nothing is lost except self-awareness inside the session.
  - **Not a UUID** – ignored with a warning, and TBD mints a fresh identifier. The session still gets its row.
  - **Names a worktree TBD already has that is not this session** – ignored with a warning, and TBD mints a fresh identifier. The existing row is never rebound, renamed, reparented, or otherwise touched. The identifier could name a local worktree or another provider's lane, and no session may take a row over by claiming its id.
  - **Names nothing yet** – the row is created with that identifier. This is the case the echo exists for.

- **`tbd_parent_worktree_id`** — the identifier, again as a UUID string, of the worktree that spawned this session. TBD uses it to nest the session's row beneath that lane in its tree, so a fan-out reads as a hierarchy rather than a flat list. The edge is presentation only: it never affects the session's git base, and TBD never reports it back to the provider.
  - **Absent, or not a UUID** – the row is created at top level in its repository. The user can move it afterwards.
  - **Names a worktree TBD does not have** – same: top level.
  - **Names an archived worktree, or a repository's main worktree** – same: top level, and the edge is not stored at all. TBD does not render either row's descendants, so nesting a live session beneath one would file it where nobody can find it.
  - **Names a live worktree** – the row is nested beneath it.
  - **Arrives on a later sighting for a row nobody has ever placed** – the row is nested then, under every rule above, plus two that only a late edge can violate: the parent may be neither the row itself nor one of the row's own descendants, since either would close a cycle. A refused late edge leaves the row at top level, exactly as an absent one would.
  - **Arrives on a later sighting for a row that already has a parent** – ignored. A provider cannot move a lane the user can already see.
  - **Arrives on a later sighting for a row the user has since moved to top level** – ignored, and this is why the rule above says "nobody has ever placed" rather than "has no parent". The two states look identical on the row's parent edge, and the stamp is static, so reading it again would undo the user's gesture on the very next poll. TBD records the fact separately: a row is offered a parent at most once in its life, whether that parent came from a stamp or from the user's own move, and after that its position is the user's alone.

A provider that populates these keys is describing TBD-side facts it was told, not facts it discovered. It MUST NOT invent either value — an identifier the provider made up would name no lane, and for `tbd_worktree_id` it would defeat the echo it is meant to serve.

### Archived sessions stay in the inventory

**A provider MUST return archived sessions from `list` and in the `events` snapshot, exactly as it returns active ones, and MUST NOT filter them out.** Archiving changes a field on the Session object; it never changes whether the session is enumerated.

Two things break if a provider filters them:

- **The drift rule misfires.** A session that vanishes from successive snapshots is, per Identity & drift below, a session that no longer exists. An archived session filtered out of `list` is indistinguishable from a deleted one, so archiving would silently mark work gone.
- **The caller loses the archived inventory.** Browsing archived sessions — to find one and revive it — requires that they be enumerable. A caller cannot browse what the provider refuses to name.

Which archived sessions a human actually sees is the caller's decision, not the provider's: a caller typically shows active sessions by default and archived ones behind a filter. That is display policy applied to a complete inventory, and it is the only place archived sessions are hidden.

### Pending question (optional)

A provider MAY include a `pending_question` field on the Session object describing a structured choice the agent is currently blocked on — for example, a multiple-choice prompt the agent's own tooling surfaced, which a calling application would otherwise only see as `agent_state: "waiting_input"` with no further detail.

```json
{
  "pending_question": {
    "id": "q-4f2a1c",
    "questions": [
      {
        "prompt": "Which environment should this change deploy to?",
        "label": "Environment",
        "multi": false,
        "options": [
          {"label": "staging", "description": "Deploy to the staging cluster"},
          {"label": "production", "description": "Deploy to the production cluster; requires a follow-up approval"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `id` — a stable identifier for this question, opaque to the caller. It stays the same while the same question is still pending and changes when the agent asks a new one, so a caller can tell "still waiting on the same thing" apart from "a new question just appeared" without diffing question text.
- `questions` — one or more question objects presented together (an agent MAY ask more than one structured question in a single blocking turn). Each has:
  - `prompt` (required) — the question text.
  - `label` (optional) — a short label for compact rendering (a tab title, a form field caption) where the full `prompt` doesn't fit.
  - `multi` (optional, default `false`) — whether more than one option may be selected.
  - `options` (required, one or more) — each an object with `label` (required, the option's display text) and `description` (optional, supporting detail).

**Lifecycle.** `pending_question` is present only while the agent is blocked on this specific question; it MUST be absent once the question is answered or abandoned (for example, because the session was stopped, or the agent moved on some other way).

Its presence is display detail layered on top of `agent_state`, never a substitute for it. A provider that reports `pending_question` MUST keep it consistent with `agent_state` — report `agent_state: "waiting_input"` for exactly as long as `pending_question` is present, and clear both together — and a caller MUST NOT infer that a session is blocked solely from `pending_question`'s presence; blocking is still read off `agent_state`, same as every other session.

**Optionality and degradation.** This field is entirely optional. A provider with no way to surface structured question data — including one with no concept of structured questions at all — simply never sets it and remains fully conformant; it MUST NOT fabricate a single-option question just to answer the general `waiting_input` case. A caller that consumes the field renders a session with `agent_state: "waiting_input"` and no `pending_question` exactly as it always has (a generic "needs input" state), and renders one with `pending_question` present with the richer card; a caller that does not consume it renders every waiting session the generic way. No capability gates this field: it rides on the Session object returned by verbs (`create`, `list`, `events`) that already exist, rather than introducing a new verb, so it follows the same rule as `meta`'s well-known keys above — a provider either populates it or doesn't, and a caller that doesn't recognize it ignores it per the response-field forward-compatibility rule in Versioning below.

**Answering.** `pending_question` is display data only — it does not add a way to answer. Answering a pending question uses the mechanisms this contract already has: attach interactively and answer the prompt directly through the terminal (`attach`), or deliver the chosen option's text as input (`send`). There is no dedicated "answer" verb. A future answer verb, if one is ever added, would need to solve two things this field alone does not: submitting a choice when no terminal is attached (so `send`'s raw-keystroke delivery isn't available), and confirming which specific `pending_question.id` the answer was directed at (`send` has no notion of a question at all, so it can't tell the provider which pending question the bytes are meant to resolve).

**No caller is obliged to consume it, and TBD does not.** TBD reads the fields of the Session object named above and `pending_question` is not among them, so a session carrying one is displayed exactly as a session without one, and there is no second path by which the structured question reaches a human. A provider MAY populate it — it costs nothing, it is correct against this contract, and a caller that grows the richer card gets it for free — but MUST NOT expect it to change how a session is presented today, and MUST NOT reach for it as a way to influence one.

**Machine-interface rule.** The same normative rule that governs `agent_state` applies here without exception: `pending_question` MUST be derived from the agent's own machine interface — its lifecycle hooks or structured tool output — and MUST NEVER be constructed by parsing rendered terminal output, including the bytes `log` returns. A provider that cannot source it this way MUST simply omit the field, exactly as it MUST report `agent_state: "unknown"` rather than guess.

### Peer messaging (optional)

A provider MAY include a `peer_messaging` object on the Session object declaring that this session can be addressed by name over the `messages` verb below.

```json
"peer_messaging": {"protocol": 1}
```

- `protocol` (required when the object is present) — the integer peer-messaging protocol the session speaks. It is a number rather than a boolean because two sides exchange messages only when they speak the same protocol, and a number is what lets that protocol move without a contract major.

**A provider MUST source this field from the remote session's own agent registry row rather than assert it.** For a Claude Code session that row is what encodes both a new-enough CLI and the absence of the messaging killswitches — two facts that cannot be inferred any other way, and that a provider cannot honestly claim on the session's behalf. A session running a different agent, a plain shell, or a Claude Code whose messaging is inactive simply has no row, so the field is absent.

**What bridges a session is the `peer` line on the `messages` stream, not this field.** TBD bridges one of a provider's sessions when a `peer` line names it in `session` and that id resolves to a worktree row TBD already has, and it speaks to that peer at the `protocol` the same line carries. The Session object takes part in neither decision. Both are downstream of the caller having peer messaging turned on at all: in TBD that is an off-by-default setting, consulted when a provider's streams are armed, and with it off no `messages` stream is opened for that provider and nothing of its is bridged, whatever any session declares or any `peer` line says. So a session that declares `peer_messaging` is bridged only once a `peer` line announces it, and a session that never declares it is bridged all the same the moment one does: declaring the field enables nothing and omitting it suppresses nothing.

**What a provider can and cannot rely on it for.** It is an inventory-level declaration and nothing more — the honest, machine-readable place to say which of a provider's sessions have a messaging half at all, answered from the same `list`/`events` inventory every other fact about a session comes from, and sourced from a row only the provider can see. Its value is that a session can be told apart from an ordinary one by reading the inventory, rather than by opening the stream and waiting to see what gets announced. A provider MUST NOT rely on it to control anything: it gates no caller behavior, and a provider whose sessions must actually be addressable announces them on the stream.

Whether a particular caller reads the field at all is not something a provider can observe: nothing is reported back either way, and a run in which it went unread looks exactly like one in which it was understood — see A caller's silence is not confirmation under Versioning below.

Like `pending_question` above, this field is optional and **no capability gates it**, for the same reason given there: it rides on the Session object returned by verbs that already exist (`create`, `list`, `events`) rather than introducing a verb of its own, so it follows the response-field forward-compatibility rule in Versioning below. The `messages` capability is a separate declaration and gates only the verb; a provider that populates `peer_messaging` without declaring `messages` has described sessions the caller has no channel to reach, and the caller will not reach them.

## Profile object

A **profile** selects an agent's identity and routing: which credential it authenticates with, and which model or endpoint it talks to. Profile and location are orthogonal — this object never says *where* a session runs (that's a property of which provider, if any, a session belongs to), only *who* it runs as.

Only a profile's name and routing may cross the process boundary to a provider — never its credential. This object is a **projection**, not a snapshot: it exists specifically because it excludes secret material, which makes it safe to hand to a provider.

```json
{
  "name": "acme-default",
  "kind": "oauth",
  "routing": {
    "model": "acme-large-v2",
    "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
    "aws_region": "us-east-1",
    "aws_profile": "acme-bedrock"
  },
  "env": {"ACME_FEATURE_FLAG": "1"},
  "credential_ref": "acme-vault://oauth/acme-default"
}
```

Every field is optional, and the whole object is optional wherever it appears — an absent `profile` means "the provider's default identity."

- `name` — display name for the identity, shown to a human.
- `kind` — `oauth`, `api_key`, or `bedrock`.
- `routing` — model/endpoint selection: `model`, `base_url`, and (for `bedrock`) `aws_region`/`aws_profile`. A provider applies whichever sub-fields the caller supplies and falls back to its own default for the rest.
- `env` — the profile's own flat string-to-string env overrides (routing-adjacent settings — not secrets; see below).
- `credential_ref` — an opaque string the provider resolves against its own secret store. The caller never interprets it; it means nothing outside the provider that issued it.

**Normative rules:**

- This object MUST NOT contain credential material of any kind.
- A caller MUST NOT put secrets in `env`.
- A provider MUST NOT echo this object into logs it doesn't own.
- `credential_ref` is opaque to the caller; only the provider that issued it knows how to resolve it.

Why credentials never travel, by kind:

- **`oauth`** — an OAuth credential's refresh token rotates on every refresh. Pushing a snapshot of one would create two independent refreshers racing on a single rotating token, and the loser's copy silently goes stale. There is no representation of an OAuth credential that is safe to transport, so `oauth` profiles only ever cross via `credential_ref`.
- **`api_key`** — an API-key secret is technically transportable, but pushing one would send it through a process the caller doesn't audit, and leave the caller with no rotation or revocation story for a copy it can no longer see. So `credential_ref` is used instead here too, even though the constraint is policy rather than physics.
- **`bedrock`** — has no secret material to transport in the first place: `routing.aws_profile` names an AWS profile/role the provider assumes using its own credential chain. `credential_ref` is typically absent for this kind.

> **Implementation note (non-normative).** A provider whose box keeps one config directory per identity — each bootstrapped once, the first time a given `credential_ref` is used — can realize both `create`'s `profile` field and `set-profile` by pointing the agent process at a different config directory and restarting it — the same technique a calling application typically uses to manage profiles for sessions it runs locally. This costs one bootstrap **per identity per box**, not per swap and not per session: once a directory exists for a given identity, every later `create` or `set-profile` against that identity just reuses it — profile swapping does not imply continuous credential syncing. This is guidance, not a requirement: the contract stays agnostic to whether a provider uses this layout, a different one, or no persistent identity at all, and it must not be read as assuming git, tmux, or any particular agent.

## `describe`

**`describe` MUST answer entirely from static local data: no network calls, no authentication.** Callers invoke it at registration time and at every application start; an expired credential or unreachable backend must never be able to break that.

```json
{
  "contract_versions": [1, 2],
  "name": "example-provider",
  "provider_version": "0.4.2",
  "capabilities": ["stop", "log", "transcript", "send", "attach", "events", "messages", "rename", "profile", "set-profile", "archive", "unarchive", "delete", "retain", "import", "recall", "seed", "land"],
  "create_params": [
    {"name": "repo",   "type": "string", "label": "Repository", "required": true},
    {"name": "branch", "type": "string", "label": "Branch", "default": "main"},
    {"name": "prompt", "type": "text",   "label": "Initial prompt"},
    {"name": "size",   "type": "enum",   "label": "Size", "values": ["small","large"], "default": "small"}
  ],
  "profile_kinds": ["oauth", "api_key", "bedrock"],
  "credential_ref_hint": "acme-vault path, e.g. acme-vault://oauth/<name>",
  "identity": {"account": "acme-prod-1234", "environment": "staging", "region": "us-east-1"}
}
```

- `contract_versions` — every contract major version this provider supports (see Versioning).
- `name` — a stable machine identifier for the provider's KIND, not for this registration of it. Two registry entries running the same executable against different backends report the same `name`, so a caller MUST NOT use it as the identity of a registration: the caller's own registry key is that identity, and is what it keys sessions, mirrors, and attach targets on.
- `identity` (optional) — see Provider identity below.
- `capabilities` — which optional verbs/features (`stop`, `log`, `transcript`, `send`, `attach`, `events`, `messages`, `rename`, `profile`, `set-profile`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `delete`, `retain`, `import`, `recall`, `seed`, `land`) this provider implements. Every capability string except `profile` and `seed` names the verb of the same name: declaring it means the verb is implemented, and omitting it means the caller never invokes it and never offers the corresponding action. `profile` and `seed` are the two exceptions — each gates whether `create` honors the stdin field of the same name (see `create` and Format scope below, and the Profile object above) rather than admitting a verb — while `set-profile` gates the verb of the same name.
- `create_params` — a flat field list, not a JSON Schema, describing the form for `create`. Supported `type` values: `string`, `text`, `bool`, `int`, `enum`. The caller renders this generically (the most complex widget is an enum dropdown) and only does required/type checks client-side — the provider is the validator of record, via the error model below. The field names `repo`, `slug`, `branch`, `prompt`, and `title` are well-known: a caller may prefill them from ambient context (e.g. a currently selected repository) when present, and for `slug` a caller may generate a lane identifier of its own choosing. Well-known is a caller-side prefill convention and nothing more: it obliges a provider to nothing, changes no validation, and a provider that declares any of these names is simply one whose form a caller can fill in without asking. A caller that can answer every `required` field this way may skip the form entirely and create straight away; one that cannot must ask rather than guess.
- `profile_kinds` and `credential_ref_hint` are meaningful only when `capabilities` includes `profile`; a provider without that capability SHOULD omit both, and a caller MUST ignore them if present without it. `profile_kinds` lists which `kind` values (from the Profile object above) this provider can actually realize. `credential_ref_hint` is placeholder text — not validation — describing the shape of a `credential_ref` this provider expects; a caller shows it as placeholder text in its credential-reference input.

### Provider identity (optional)

`identity` is a flat string-to-string map of **non-secret display pairs naming the backend this registration is pointed at** — the account, environment, region, box, or endpoint a human needs in order to tell two registrations apart. It answers the question `name` cannot: `name` identifies the provider's kind, so two registry entries running the same executable against a production and a staging control plane report the same `name`, and a caller that leads with it shows the same label for both.

A caller cannot derive this itself. A registration is an executable path and a flag list, and the mapping from those flags to a control plane is the provider's private business, so a caller that inferred an environment from an argument would be guessing precisely where a wrong answer is most expensive.

```json
"identity": {"account": "acme-prod-1234", "environment": "staging", "box": "i-0abc123def"}
```

- **Entirely optional**, like every other additive field: a provider that omits it stays fully conformant, and a caller MUST degrade to whatever identity it can derive locally (its own registry key, and the command it runs).
- **Answered from static local data, no network and no authentication**, on the same terms as the rest of `describe`. A provider that would have to call its backend to learn a value omits that key rather than making `describe` fall over on an expired credential.
- **Values are display text and are never interpreted.** The keys `account`, `environment`, `region`, `box`, `host`, and `endpoint` are well-known only in the sense that a caller MAY order them first; no key is required, none changes any behavior, and every other key renders opaquely beside them. This mirrors `meta` on the Session object, and degrades the same way: a value that is not a string costs its own key, and an `identity` that is not an object costs the map without costing the `describe` response.
- **It MUST NOT carry credential material** — no token, secret, password, session credential, or signature, whole or partial. Identity here means *which backend*, never *how to reach it*. A caller displays these pairs to a human, and a value that must not be displayed does not belong in the map. TBD additionally drops any pair whose key names credential material rather than trusting this rule alone, so a provider that violates it loses the pair rather than leaking it.

`describe.capabilities` reports **interface capabilities**: which contract verbs TBD may call. It does not prove that a session has the external **task capabilities** a workload needs. A provider or workflow that claims ownership transfer or completion MUST preflight the concrete external capabilities required by that task and fail visibly before transfer when they are unavailable. Successful `create`, `state: "running"`, or `send` handoff proves only that the corresponding contract or transport step succeeded; it does not prove workload permission. The provider or higher-level workflow owns this preflight because TBD cannot infer vendor-specific permissions from the provider contract.

## `create`

stdin:

```json
{
  "params": {"repo": "acme/api", "branch": "fix-ci", "prompt": "..."},
  "profile": {"name": "acme-default", "kind": "oauth", "credential_ref": "acme-vault://oauth/acme-default"},
  "seed": {"retained_key": "opaque-provider-string"},
  "idempotency_key": "tbd-9a1c..."
}
```

`profile` (optional) is a Profile object (see above) selecting the identity the new session's agent should run as. It is meaningful only when the provider declares the `profile` capability; a provider that doesn't declare it MUST ignore the field — per the ignore-unknown-fields rule in Versioning — and create the session against its own default identity rather than error. An absent `profile` always means the provider's default identity, regardless of capability.

`seed` (optional) names a retained transcript the new session begins with as its history: `{"retained_key": "<key>"}`, where the key came from a `retain` or `import` receipt this same provider issued (see Keys below). It is a top-level sibling of `profile` and `idempotency_key`, never a member of the provider-defined `params`, and the payload it names is Claude Code transcript JSONL (see Format scope below).

`seed` is gated by the `seed` capability, which names the field it gates rather than a verb — the same shape `profile` has. A provider that has not declared `seed` MUST ignore the field, per the ignore-unknown-fields rule in Versioning, and a caller MUST NOT send it to such a provider. That obligation is the whole point of gating the field: because an unrecognized stdin field is dropped silently rather than refused, an ungated `seed` sent to a provider that does not implement it would produce an unseeded session the caller believed carried a conversation, with nothing on either side to say so. `idempotency_key` dedupe covers a seeded create unchanged — replaying a key that already produced a session returns that same session rather than seeding a second one.

`seed` is an object rather than a bare key string so that a future inline source — `{"transcript": [...]}` — needs neither a new field nor a new capability.

If `create_params` exposes the well-known `prompt` field, the provider owns clearing any agent startup or trust gate before delivering that prompt. Writing prompt bytes while another interactive gate owns the TTY does not count as delivery. Providers SHOULD use agent flags or machine interfaces to clear and verify such gates, and MUST NOT infer readiness by parsing cosmetic TUI output.

Response: a Session object.

`create` MUST return within seconds. If provisioning is slow, return immediately with `state: "starting"` and let `list` (or `events`) carry the session to `running` later.

The caller may retry a timed-out `create` call using the **same** `idempotency_key`. The provider MUST dedupe on this key: replaying a key that already produced a session returns that same session rather than creating a duplicate. This is what makes "the transport timed out but the session actually started" safe to retry.

## `list`

Returns `{"complete": true, "sessions": [Session, ...]}`.

The `sessions` array carries every session the provider knows about, archived ones included (see Archived sessions stay in the inventory, above).

Providers SHOULD keep exited sessions listable for at least 24 hours (with `state: "exited"`) rather than dropping them from the list immediately. A session disappearing from the list is indistinguishable from transport drift unless exited sessions stick around long enough to be told apart from a genuine loss.

A transport-overload or unreachable failure MUST be returned as a transient error (exit 3), never as a successful empty list. The caller keeps its last successful snapshot and marks the provider stale; an empty successful complete snapshot instead counts toward the two-absence rule and can incorrectly mark live sessions gone.

### Snapshot completeness

`complete` declares whether the array is the provider's **entire** inventory or only part of it. The same field, with the same meaning, rides on the `events` stream's `snapshot` event.

- `complete: true` — the provider enumerated everything it has. The snapshot is authoritative about absence as well as presence.
- `complete: false` — the provider could enumerate only part of its inventory. The snapshot is authoritative about presence only.
- Absent — MUST be read as `true`. A provider that always enumerates everything need never emit the field.

**What a caller may do with an incomplete snapshot.** It MAY adopt sessions it has not seen before, and it MAY update the state of sessions it already tracks — a session that appears in a partial view has been positively observed, and that observation is as good as any other.

**What a caller MUST NOT do with one.** It MUST NOT retire anything on the strength of an incomplete snapshot: no session may be advanced toward `gone`, marked removed, or dropped from the mirror because it is missing from a snapshot that never claimed to see everything (see Identity & drift below). And it MUST NOT treat an incomplete snapshot as **refreshing freshness** — the snapshot does not update the caller's "last successful snapshot" timestamp, does not clear a staleness indicator, and does not re-open any mutation gate that staleness had closed. A partial inventory presented as current would show a half-blind view as if it were the whole truth, and would re-enable mutations against sessions the caller cannot currently see.

**`complete` means complete with respect to the full set, archived sessions included.** A provider that can enumerate its active sessions but not its archived ones reports `complete: false`, even though the active half is exhaustive. Completeness is a claim about the inventory this contract mirrors, not about whichever subset was easiest to reach.

Reporting `complete: false` is always safe and never a failure: a provider whose discovery path is degraded, rate-limited, or partially unavailable SHOULD return what it can with `complete: false` in preference to either failing the whole call or passing a truncated list off as complete.

## `stop <id>` (optional)

Terminates a running session. Whether termination is graceful, forceful, or graceful-then-forceful is entirely the provider's business.

`stop` means exactly one thing: end the running compute. It does **not** retire the session from the inventory — that is `archive`, and the two are independent operations a caller may perform in either order or not at all. A stopped session remains listed, with `state: "exited"` and whatever `archived` value it already had.

`stop` is idempotent: stopping an id that is already dead, or unknown, exits 0 and returns the session in a terminal state — at minimum `{"id": "...", "state": "exited"}`.

The verb is optional and declared via the `stop` capability. Not every backend exposes termination: a platform that reclaims idle sessions on its own schedule, with no client-facing kill, can retire a session but cannot terminate one, and such a provider MUST NOT declare `stop`. A caller MUST NOT offer a stop action for a provider that hasn't declared it — there is no fallback, and a provider without `stop` is fully usable without one.

## `archive <id>` / `unarchive <id>` (optional)

`archive` retires a session from the working inventory by setting `archived: true` on it; `unarchive` returns it by setting `archived: false`. Response in both cases: the updated Session object.

**Normative semantics:**

- Both verbs are idempotent. Archiving an already-archived session, or unarchiving one that isn't archived, exits 0 and returns the session unchanged.
- Neither verb removes the session from `list` or from the `events` snapshot. Archiving is a field change, not a deletion.
- Neither verb is a statement about liveness. Archiving MAY have side effects the provider considers part of retiring a session (a platform whose archived sessions refuse new messages, for instance, is behaving correctly), but a caller MUST read liveness off `state` as always, and MUST NOT infer that an archived session is stopped or that an active session is unarchived.
- The `id` in each response MUST be the same `<id>` passed on the invocation line.

The two verbs are declared separately (`archive`, `unarchive`), because a backend may be able to retire a session without being able to bring it back. A provider that declares `archive` alone is conformant; a caller then offers archiving and simply has no unarchive action.

Failure follows the standard error model below — for example, exit 1 with `code: "not_found"` if `<id>` no longer exists.

## `delete <id> [--retain]` (optional)

Destroys the session: ends its compute if it is still running, and removes it from the inventory permanently. It is the third act alongside the two above — `stop` ends compute without retiring the session, `archive` retires the session without ending compute, and `delete` leaves nothing behind.

**A provider MUST NOT declare `delete` unless a successful delete of a running session also ends that session's compute.** A provider that cannot end compute for a given session MUST refuse that delete with exit 1 rather than remove the record. This contract already recognizes backends with no client-facing kill and forbids them from declaring `stop`; such a backend declaring `delete` would strand compute that nothing enumerates and no reconciler can reach.

Response:

```json
{"id": "fix-flaky-ci", "deleted": true}
```

- `id` (required) — MUST be the same `<id>` passed on the invocation line.
- `deleted` (required) — `true` when this call destroyed a session, `false` when there was nothing to destroy.

**The response is deliberately not a Session object.** Every other verb that changes a session returns one; this verb must not, because a caller that has just been told a session no longer exists must not be handed inventory-shaped data about it. The caller's adoption path reads a session object as a session to track, so returning one here would re-adopt the very session the response declares gone.

**`delete` is idempotent.** Deleting an unknown or already-deleted id exits 0 with `"deleted": false`, matching the idempotence `stop` and `archive` already have: asking for a state a session is already in is not an error.

**Filing never gates destruction.** An archived session MAY be deleted, and a caller need not unarchive one first: `archived` is a filing decision and says nothing about whether a session may be destroyed.

**`delete` overrides the exited-session retention SHOULD.** Providers SHOULD keep exited sessions listable for at least 24 hours (see `list` above) so that a disappearance can be told apart from transport drift. A deleted session is exempt, because its disappearance was requested by the caller rather than observed by it, and there is nothing to tell apart.

**A provider that declares `events` MUST emit `{"event": "removed", "id": ...}` after a successful delete.** `removed` already means "stop tracking this at all", which is exactly the fact a delete establishes.

**`--retain` retains the session's transcript before destroying it**, and is valid only where the provider also declares the `retain` capability. When the flag is passed — and only then — the response carries the same receipt `retain` returns:

```json
{"id": "fix-flaky-ci", "deleted": true, "retained": {"key": "opaque-provider-string", "expires_at": "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z", "bytes": 148213}}
```

Without the flag, nothing is retained and no `retained` object appears. **Retention is never implied by capability presence.** A caller that did not ask for storage MUST NOT have storage allocated on its behalf, and a response shape MUST NOT vary with which capabilities a provider happens to hold.

There is no `--force` at this layer. Refusing to destroy live or dirty work is caller policy — the caller has `stop` to sequence and the `workspace_dirty` key to consult — and a provider that second-guesses an explicit delete leaves the caller no way through.

Failure follows the standard error model below.

## `retain <id>` / `import` (optional)

Both verbs put a transcript into the provider's own durable store and return the same receipt:

```json
{"key": "opaque-provider-string", "expires_at": "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z", "bytes": 148213}
```

`retain <id>` stores the transcript of a session this provider owns. `import` reads Claude Code transcript JSONL on stdin and stores it, with no session on this provider involved at all — that is how a conversation from somewhere else, including one that ran on the caller's own machine, enters the store.

- `key` (required) — the opaque handle `recall` and `create`'s `seed` field take. See Keys below.
- `bytes` (required) — the count of transcript bytes stored. It is how a caller detects a truncated `recall`, so a provider MUST emit it.
- `expires_at` (optional) — when the provider intends to drop the record. **An absent `expires_at` means the provider makes no claim, never "kept forever".** A caller MUST NOT render its absence as a guarantee of permanence.

Malformed JSONL on `import` is a permanent error with `code: "invalid_params"`.

Providers SHOULD expire retained transcripts nobody recalls. Retention is storage a caller asked for, and a store with no expiry policy grows without bound.

**These are two verbs and two capabilities rather than one verb with an operand or a `--stdin` flag.** Every capability string but the two that gate a `create` field names the verb of the same name, and the two acts have genuinely different prerequisites: a backend may be able to snapshot its own sessions while being unable to accept a foreign blob, and one capability cannot say that. Separately, stdin is a property of a verb here — `create`, `send`, and `set-profile` read it unconditionally, and nothing else reads it at all — so a flag that switched it on would be the only one of its kind. Detecting a tty instead would be worse: TBD always invokes providers without one, so the heuristic would be constant-true in the caller that matters.

Failure follows the standard error model below — for example, exit 1 with `code: "not_found"` if `retain`'s `<id>` no longer exists.

## `recall <key>` (optional)

Writes a retained transcript to stdout as Claude Code transcript JSONL, in the same format `transcript` returns (see `transcript` below). It works for any key the provider issued, whether or not the session that produced the transcript still exists — which is the point of retaining one.

**`recall` writes nothing to stderr**, so this contract keeps exactly one stderr exception. `recall` does not inherit `transcript`'s cursor envelope: a cursor exists because a live transcript grows and is fetched incrementally, while a retained transcript is immutable, so `--since` would have nothing to mean. Truncation — the cursor's other job — is detected against the `bytes` the receipt carried.

- Unknown key: exit 1 with `code: "not_found"`.
- A key the provider issued and has since aged out: exit 1 with `code: "expired"` (see Error model below), so a caller can say that a record lapsed rather than claim it never existed.

Both are permanent errors.

**It is a separate verb rather than `transcript --key`.** The operand is a different identifier namespace — a key is not a session id — and the `transcript` capability must keep meaning "live transcripts work" rather than becoming ambiguous about which of two paths a provider implements.

### Keys

A key is an opaque provider-issued string, on the same terms as a `transcript` cursor or a `credential_ref`. A caller MUST NOT parse, order, compare, construct, or pattern-match one; it stores whatever a receipt gave it and passes that value back verbatim.

- **Keys are provider-scoped.** A key is meaningful only to the provider that issued it, so a caller keys every key by the pair `(provider name, key)` and MUST NOT present one to a different provider.
- **A key is an identifier, not an authorization.** `recall` authenticates exactly as every other verb does, and holding a key grants nothing on its own. A key is therefore not a bearer secret — which is what lets a caller log it, print it, and store it beside the rest of its inventory rather than treating it as credential material.

### Format scope

`import`, `recall`, and `create`'s `seed` field all fix the payload as Claude Code transcript JSONL, the same format `transcript` returns. The rest of this contract assumes no particular agent, so these three are a real narrowing of it: a provider whose sessions are not Claude Code sessions simply declines these capabilities and remains fully conformant, and other agents' transcript formats are out of scope.

## `log <id> [--lines N]`

Writes raw scrollback bytes to stdout: the last `N` lines (default 2000), with ANSI passthrough intact. This is display data for a read-only view, not a JSON envelope.

`log` exists for providers that host a terminal. A provider whose sessions have no terminal to scroll simply doesn't declare it.

Rendering scrollback to a human is not the thing the machine-interface rule (above) forbids — that rule is about *inferring `agent_state`* from rendered text. Showing the same text to a human to read is fine.

## `transcript <id> [--since <cursor>]` (optional)

Writes the session's conversation to stdout as Claude Code transcript JSONL — one JSON record per line, in the record format the agent itself writes: user turns, agent responses, and tool activity as structured data. Records only; no framing, no envelope, no trailing summary.

`--since <cursor>` requests only what accumulated after `<cursor>`. Invoked without it, the provider returns the transcript from the beginning.

**The continuation cursor is returned in a JSON envelope on stderr, not on stdout:**

```json
{"cursor": "opaque-provider-string"}
```

This is the single exception to "stderr is diagnostic only", and the split is deliberate. stdout carries data records and nothing else, so a response cut short by a dropped transport is recognizable as a truncated data stream. Were the cursor a trailing control record on stdout, its absence would have two indistinguishable causes — the stream ended early, or the provider has no incremental support and never emits one — and a caller with no way to tell those apart would either discard good data or silently accept a truncated transcript as the whole conversation.

**Cursors are opaque to the caller.** It stores whatever the provider last returned and passes that value back verbatim on the next call. A caller MUST NOT parse, order, compare, arithmetically manipulate, or construct a cursor, and MUST NOT carry one across providers or sessions.

A provider without incremental support emits no cursor envelope and remains fully conformant; the caller then refetches the whole transcript each time. A provider that emits a cursor MUST accept its own most recently issued cursor on a subsequent `--since`, and SHOULD treat a cursor it can no longer honor as a request to return the transcript from the beginning rather than as an error.

**`transcript` and `log` are different data, not two encodings of the same data.** `log` is raw ANSI scrollback bytes for a read-only terminal view; `transcript` is structured conversation records for a message-level view. Structured records poured into a scrollback view lose every tool card; ANSI bytes fed to a transcript renderer produce garbage. A provider MAY implement either, both, or neither, and a caller MUST NOT substitute one for the other.

The machine-interface rule applies here as everywhere: transcript records MUST come from the agent's own transcript data and MUST NEVER be reconstructed by parsing rendered terminal output.

## `send <id>`

stdin bytes are delivered verbatim to the session as keystrokes. The provider does not add a terminator. When a caller means the terminal Enter key, it MUST append carriage return (`\r`, byte `0x0D`); line feed (`\n`, byte `0x0A`) is not equivalent in a raw PTY and may fail to submit the line. Exit 0 means the bytes were handed to the transport, not that the agent has acted on them.

## `rename <id> <title>` (optional)

`<title>` is passed as a single argv value — TBD invokes the provider directly, never through a shell, so the caller need not shell-escape it, and the provider must accept it verbatim including spaces. Response: the updated Session object (with `title` reflecting the new value).

This lets a caller push a display name to the provider so other clients of the same backend — another machine, or the provider's own UI — see it too. The verb is optional and declared via the `rename` capability, and MUST stay optional: a caller keeps its own display name for a session regardless of whether the provider can persist one, so a provider that cannot support renaming (or cannot support it for some sessions) remains fully usable without it. A caller SHOULD invoke `rename` when the capability is present so the name doesn't drift between clients, but MUST NOT require it to succeed in order to rename a session locally.

Failure follows the standard error model below (for example, exit 1 with `code: "not_found"` if `id` no longer exists).

## `set-profile <id>` (optional)

Swaps the identity a running session's agent process authenticates and routes as, in place — without recreating the session.

stdin: a Profile object (see above) — the same shape `create`'s `profile` field takes.

Response: the updated Session object.

**Normative semantics:**

- The workspace and session identity are preserved: the `id` in the response MUST be the same `<id>` passed on the invocation line.
- The agent process is restarted against the new identity (a new `credential_ref`, `routing`, or both).
- The session MUST NOT be recreated — this is a live swap of an existing session, not stop-then-create.
- Scrollback preservation across the restart is the provider's business, not a contract requirement — but the session's identity and continued existence are not renegotiable regardless of whether scrollback survives.

This mirrors what a local swap already does for a session run directly by the calling application: kill the agent in place, respawn it against a different identity, and leave the workspace, session, and scrollback alone. `set-profile` exists so a provider whose box is laid out the same way — one config directory per identity — can offer that same seamless swap remotely (see the implementation note under Profile object above).

The verb is optional and declared via the `set-profile` capability. It is meaningful only alongside the `profile` capability — a provider that cannot accept a profile at `create` time has no default identity to swap away from, and SHOULD NOT declare `set-profile` without also declaring `profile`. A caller keeps its own record of which profile a session runs as regardless of whether the provider can accept a live swap; a provider without this capability remains fully usable, it just cannot be told to swap a running session's identity (only, if at all, at `create` time).

Failure follows the standard error model below: `not_found` if `<id>` no longer exists, `credential_unresolvable` if the profile's `credential_ref` doesn't resolve (see Error model), or `invalid_params` for a malformed profile object.

## `land <id>` (optional)

Reports where a session's work lives, so a caller can reconstruct it as a local checkout. `land` answers a question — it performs no git operation, creates nothing, and changes no session state.

Response:

```json
{
  "remote_url": "git@github.com:acme/api.git",
  "branch": "claude/fix-flaky-ci",
  "resume_command": ["claude", "--teleport", "sess_01ABC"],
  "forks": true
}
```

- `remote_url` (required) — the git remote the session's work is pushed to.
- `branch` (required) — the branch that work is on.
- `resume_command` (optional) — argv the caller MAY run in the first pane of the reconstructed checkout to resume the conversation. It is argv, never a shell string: a caller executes it directly and never through a shell. Omitted when there is nothing to resume.
- `forks` (required) — whether local work continues to reach the remote session.
  - `true` — the local copy and the remote session diverge from the moment of landing. A caller MUST present that fork as a fork rather than implying that typing in one reaches the other, and MAY land the same session more than once, since each landing is an independent line of work.
  - `false` — the landed copy and the remote session remain one conversation, and work done locally continues to reach it. A caller MUST NOT present divergence, and MUST NOT offer a second landing of the same session: two local copies of a non-forking session would be two writers on one conversation, which the contract gives no way to reconcile. A provider that cannot guarantee that continuity MUST report `true` — `false` is a promise about where subsequent work goes, and over-reporting it silently loses work.

**None of these fields are trusted input.** For an external provider they come from an executable the user registered; for one built into the caller they may come from session metadata stored on a remote server, including metadata written by another device. Either way they are attacker-influenceable strings that are about to meet a program that takes options and executes transports. Three rules are mandatory:

- **`branch` MUST be validated before it reaches git.** A caller MUST reject any value that does not satisfy every rule below, and providers can rely on a plain branch name always being accepted:
  - composed only of ASCII letters, digits, and the characters `.`, `_`, `-`, and `/`
  - does not begin with `-` (git would read it as an option rather than a ref), `.`, or `/`
  - does not end with `/`, `.`, or the suffix `.lock`
  - contains no `..`, no `//`, no `@{`, and no ASCII control characters or space
  - is not the single character `@`

  These rules are a strict subset of what `git check-ref-format --branch` accepts. A caller MAY additionally run that command, but MUST NOT rely on it alone: the pattern above is the contract, so a provider can predict acceptance without matching one git version's behavior. A provider that emits ordinary branch names — including the `<prefix>/<name>` shapes agents typically produce — will never see a rejection.
- **`remote_url` MUST only ever be compared, never passed to git as a remote argument.** A caller compares it against the local repository's already-configured remote and refuses to proceed on a mismatch. It MUST NOT hand the value to git as a remote: git's remote-URL grammar includes the `ext::` transport family, which executes a command, so a provider-supplied URL reaching git as a remote is command execution.
- **`resume_command` MUST come only from a registered provider executable** — one the user deliberately registered, or an implementation the caller itself ships. A caller MUST NEVER accept a resume command from repository content or any other channel that is not a registered provider.

Failure follows the standard error model below — `not_found` for an unknown `<id>`, and a permanent error when the session has no landable work (for example, nothing was ever pushed).

## `attach <id>`

The caller execs the provider directly on the controlling TTY of a terminal pane and gets out of the way — the provider becomes a live shim between that TTY and the remote session. This gives the provider a live hook to refresh credentials, retry a dropped channel, or exit with code 4 plus remediation on an auth failure.

**A successful attach MUST target the requested `<id>`.** If the provider
cannot establish that targeted attach, it MUST exit non-zero using the standard
error model; it MUST NOT silently fall back to a provider-wide session picker,
an unrelated session, or a plain remote shell. Human-facing commands outside
this contract may offer those fallbacks, but a machine caller cannot distinguish
such a terminal from a successful attach without parsing rendered terminal
output, which this contract explicitly forbids. A retryable targeting or
transport failure uses exit 3.

**Pane exit means the viewer detached — it never means the session is dead.** The only source of truth for whether a session is still alive is `list` (or `events`); `attach` exiting is purely a local, viewer-side event.

**`attach` SHOULD exit 3 within 30 seconds of losing its transport**, rather than holding the pane open on a dead channel. Transport liveness is the provider's own signal — keepalives, channel state, whatever the transport gives it — and it is never output silence: an idle session legitimately writes nothing for hours. This bound exists because the exit is the caller's *only* signal, given the parsing prohibition below: a child that keeps running on a dead socket is indistinguishable from an idle session, so every recovery path the caller has — reconnect backoff, the Reattach affordance — waits forever on an exit that never comes. Every long-lived verb carries a liveness bound — `events` treats 90 seconds of silence as dead, `messages` 30 — and 30 is the right one here because `attach`, like `messages`, is a channel a person is watching in real time.

**A caller MAY kill and re-exec `attach` at any moment**, including immediately after a network path change or a wake from sleep, and a provider MUST tolerate it. The targeting rule above and the provider owning all session state mean the session itself loses nothing — a fresh `attach <id>` lands on the same session. What a restart costs falls entirely on the viewer: the pane's local scrollback goes with the killed child, and what replaces it is whatever the provider paints on a fresh connect, since repainting is no more required here than scrollback preservation is across `set-profile`. A provider MUST NOT treat a killed viewer as a reason to change the session's own state.

**`attach`'s stdout is a PTY byte stream and MUST NOT be parsed.** Unlike every other verb, there is no JSON object — not even the error object — to read here. A pre-connection auth failure still exits 4 per the error model below, and that **exit code alone** is what the caller correlates. A caller that wants the accompanying `message`/`remediation` gets it from a subsequent structured verb (`list`), never by reading attach's bytes.

(An alternative design where the provider prints a command line for the caller to exec instead was considered and rejected: it freezes credentials at print time, gives the provider no reconnect or cleanup hook once running, and leaks provider-internal argv into the caller's process table.)

## `events` (optional)

A long-running NDJSON stream: one JSON object per line, connection held open indefinitely.

```json
{"event": "hello", "contract_version": 2}
{"event": "snapshot", "complete": true, "sessions": [Session, ...]}
{"event": "session", "session": { ...Session object... }}
{"event": "removed", "id": "fix-flaky-ci"}
{"event": "ping"}
```

- Every connection MUST open with a `hello` event immediately followed by a `snapshot` event carrying the current session list, archived sessions included.
- The `snapshot` event carries `complete` with exactly the meaning and the caller rules specified for `list` above, including that an absent `complete` reads as `true` and that an incomplete snapshot neither retires sessions nor refreshes freshness.
- **Snapshot-on-connect is the entire resync mechanism — there are no cursors, sequence numbers, or replay-from-offset.** If a caller misses a transition, the cost is one reconnect, which re-establishes full state via the next snapshot.
- `session` events carry the complete session object, never a partial diff. This makes them idempotent and safely replayable in any order relative to other `session` events.
- `removed` means the session should no longer be tracked at all. It is distinct both from the session reaching `state: "exited"` and from it becoming `archived: true` — those are ordinary changes to a session that still exists, and both are delivered as `session` events.
- The provider MUST emit `ping` at least every 30 seconds while otherwise idle. A caller that sees 90 seconds of silence should treat the stream as dead, terminate the process, and reconnect.
- If the stream capability is absent, or a stream repeatedly fails to stay up, the caller falls back to polling `list` on an interval (on the order of 60s). Every provider gets at least this floor of freshness for free, whether or not it implements `events`.

## `messages` (optional)

A long-running **duplex** NDJSON stream: one JSON object per line in each direction, held open indefinitely. stdin carries lines from the caller to the provider, stdout carries lines from the provider to the caller, and both halves stay live for the life of the process.

The stream exists so that agent sessions on either side can address each other by name, the way sessions running on one machine already do. It is a registry-sync protocol as much as a message pipe: most of its traffic announces which sessions are currently addressable, and every message frame is addressed by a handle one of those announcements minted.

**Exactly one connection per provider.** A caller opens one `messages` stream per provider and never one per session, for the reason Channel granularity gives below for `events`: message traffic is aggregate, small, and shared, so a single connection is enough to keep every session's addressability current. The per-session shape `attach` uses exists only because an interactive byte stream cannot be multiplexed; message frames can be, and are.

**The caller dials, in both directions.** The caller invokes `<exec> messages` and the provider answers on the process it was started as. **Every connection this stream rides on — the provider's own reach to wherever its sessions actually run included — MUST be established outward from the caller's side.** Neither the provider executable nor the remote half it speaks to may require the caller to accept an inbound connection, to listen on an address the remote side can reach, or to be addressable at all; a remote half answers on the connection it is handed, and when that connection ends it waits to be dialed again rather than reconnecting on its own. This is a requirement rather than an implementation detail: a host running sessions is generally reachable while a caller's own machine generally is not, so the direction that can be relied upon to connect is the one this contract fixes.

Line kinds:

```json
{"kind": "hello", "protocol": 1, "origin": "acme-laptop"}
{"kind": "peer", "handle": "h-4f2a1c", "name": "acme-laptop:fix-flaky-ci %388", "status": "working", "protocol": 1}
{"kind": "peer", "handle": "p-7c02b9", "name": "fix flaky CI", "status": "working", "protocol": 1, "session": "fix-flaky-ci"}
{"kind": "peer-gone", "handle": "h-4f2a1c"}
{"kind": "message", "id": "m-8c31d4", "to": "h-9b71e0", "from": "h-4f2a1c", "content": "..."}
{"kind": "peer-inventory", "handles": ["h-4f2a1c", "h-9b71e0"]}
{"kind": "ping"}
```

- **`hello`** — both directions. The caller writes it first and the provider answers with its own. It declares the sender's origin label and the peer protocol it will speak. Neither side may write any other line before it.
- **`peer`** — both directions. Announces or updates one session the sender can be asked to deliver to: its handle, its display name, its status, the peer protocol it speaks, and — from a provider — the `session` it announces. Like a `session` event on the `events` stream, a `peer` line carries that peer's **complete** state and never a partial diff, which makes it idempotent and safely replayable in any order relative to other `peer` lines. The two `peer` lines in the block above are one of each direction: the caller's carries the name the caller composed, and the provider's carries the `session` that says which of its sessions is being announced.
- **`peer-gone`** — both directions. That handle is no longer addressable. It means what `removed` means on `events`: stop tracking this, rather than any claim about the underlying session's liveness.
- **`message`** — both directions. One frame for delivery, addressed to a handle the receiving side previously announced, and carrying an `id` the sender mints for it. Every field is required: a `message` missing one of them is malformed, and is dropped and counted like any other malformed line.
- **`peer-inventory`** — provider to caller only. Periodic, and the complete set of handles the provider currently publishes on its own side. The caller diffs it against what it asked the provider to publish and surfaces the difference. Its cadence is under Inventory cadence below.
- **`ping`** — both directions. Keepalive, as on `events`.

**Handles are opaque, and each side mints the handles for its own peers.** A handle names one addressable session for the life of one connection and means nothing outside it: a receiver MUST NOT parse it, derive anything from it, persist it across connections, or use it to address a session on any other stream. Raw addressing detail — a socket path, a process id, a terminal pane — MUST NOT travel on this stream in either direction. Delivery is a lookup of a handle in a table the receiving side built from its own announcements and never shares, so a wire that carried real addresses instead would let either side name a session the other never offered.

**Announce before you address.** A `message` naming a handle the receiving side has not been told about is dropped and counted — never held against a `peer` line that might arrive later, and never delivered on a guess.

**`session` says which of the provider's sessions a `peer` line announces, and a provider MUST put it on every `peer` line it writes.** Its value is exactly the `id` on the Session object that `list` and `events` already return for that session — the same identity, reused, never a second one minted for this stream. It is not addressing detail of the kind the handle rule above forbids: it is the provider's own public identifier for a session, already carried by every verb that returns one, and it is what lets a caller join the announcement to the session it already knows about. That join is load-bearing rather than convenient. Everything a caller needs to publish the peer locally — the name it will be shown under, and a working directory that exists on the caller's own machine — comes from the caller's record of that session, not from anything the provider asserted on this line; the provider's `name` on a `peer` line it writes is display detail for a human, and the path the session runs at resolves to nothing on the caller's machine.

**A `peer` line from a provider that omits `session`, or that names a session the caller does not know, is not published.** The caller surfaces it as a peer it could not site rather than inventing an identity or a directory for it, and nothing can address it: a handle that was never announced is a handle nothing resolves. This costs that session its addressability and nothing else — every other verb still works on it — and it is recoverable without a reconnect, since the next `peer` line for that session is a complete statement and will be published the moment the caller can site it.

**In the caller → provider direction `session` is not required.** A provider publishes the name the caller composed and needs nothing further to do it, and the handle is the provider's stable key for that peer either way.

**Protocol.** The `protocol` number in `hello`, and on each `peer` line, is the peer-messaging protocol, which is independent of the contract major in `TBD_CONTRACT_VERSION` and moves on its own. A side bridges only peers whose declared protocol it speaks, and drops any line declaring a different one. There is no down-negotiation: each side states one number and refuses the rest. A caller announces a session of its own only when that session is genuinely addressable, and bridges a provider's session on the strength of the `peer` line that announces it, so the `protocol` on that line must match. **So must the one in the provider's `hello`, and that one costs incomparably more.** A `peer` line refused for its protocol costs one session its addressability; a `hello` refused for its protocol never completes the handshake, so every line after it is dropped as arriving before one, the link never comes up, and the caller kills the stream at the silence limit and reconnects into the same refusal forever. Only `hello` and `peer` declare a protocol at all — a `message` rides a link whose `hello` matched, addressed to a handle a matching `peer` line announced, and carries no number of its own. What the Session object's `peer_messaging` does and does not do is under Peer messaging above.

**Resync is by `hello`, not by cursor.** There are no cursors, sequence numbers, or replay-from-offset here, the same as the snapshot-on-connect rule `events` states. When a connection ends, each side unlinks everything it published on the other's behalf and forgets every handle it was given; the next connection opens with `hello` and a fresh announcement of the whole roster. If either side misses a transition, the cost is one reconnect.

**Keepalive.** Both sides MUST emit `ping` at least every 10 seconds while otherwise idle, and a side that sees 30 seconds of silence MUST treat the stream as dead and terminate it. What follows the termination differs by side, under the dial rule above: the caller redials, while the provider tears down its own half and waits to be dialed rather than reaching back. **These limits are deliberately tighter than the `events` stream's 30 and 90 seconds.** The cost of stale state on `events` is a badge that lags; here it is a session writing into a void, believing it is still talking to a peer nothing can reach. Detection latency is the entire bound on how long that lie can last, which is why this stream buys a faster answer with more keepalive traffic.

**Inventory cadence.** A provider SHOULD emit `peer-inventory` at least every 30 seconds — this stream's silence limit, so a divergence is never more than one silence window old, and any connection that lives long enough for a leak to matter carries at least one. It is a SHOULD where the keepalive above is a MUST because the two absences cost different things. Silence past the limit means the link may be lying about reachability, so it kills the connection; a late inventory delays only the detection of a leak that nothing else on this stream can see, and delays it by exactly how late it is. A caller MUST NOT read a missing or late inventory as a claim about what the provider publishes — an inventory that never arrives says nothing, only one that arrives is diffable — and MUST NOT terminate the stream for its absence.

**Frames are capped at 512 KB**, measured as the encoded line without its terminating newline. A side that receives a longer line MUST drop it and count the drop rather than truncate it or parse a prefix; a side asked to send one MUST fail that frame rather than emit it. No line on this stream is fragmented or continued across lines.

**Nothing here is acknowledged, and nothing is buffered.** There are no acks, no receipts, and no store-and-forward: a frame that cannot be delivered now is dropped and counted, not queued. A sender learns a peer is unreachable from that peer's `peer-gone` or from the stream ending, never from a per-frame result. A frame accepted for delivery on a link that dies before it lands is lost after the sender saw no error; that window is accepted rather than solved, because the alternative is a mailbox with its own durability, eviction, and reclamation story that messaging between two sessions on one machine does not have either.

**The `id` on a `message` is diagnostic, and it is not an acknowledgement.** The sending side mints an opaque value that is unique for the life of one connection, and both sides MUST log it wherever they log the frame, including where they drop it. Its only purpose is that one frame can be named identically in both sides' logs: with nothing acknowledged, a frame that is dropped somewhere on the hop is this stream's characteristic failure, and an id is what lets two logs be read as one record of it rather than as two unrelated tallies. It carries no delivery semantics whatever. Nothing is ever returned for it — no receipt, no result, no report of what a receiver did with a frame — and a sender learns no more about whether a frame landed than it does without one. A receiver MUST NOT parse it, derive anything from it, retry or wait on anything keyed on it, or treat a repeated id as a replay to suppress; a sender MUST NOT expect any of those. It names one frame's hop across this stream and nothing inside `content`, whose interior this contract does not reach.

### Provider obligations on `messages`

Everything above, a caller can observe from its own side. The following it largely cannot, so they are stated as obligations a provider declaring `messages` MUST satisfy:

- **Close and unlink its listeners when the link drops.** An endpoint that stays reachable while the link is down is worse than none at all: it accepts every message sent to it, reports success to the sender, and discards them. Refusing the connection outright is what makes a sender see the same failure it would see against a session that had exited, and it is the only signal available, since nothing on this stream is acknowledged.
- **Unlink every peer it published on the caller's behalf when the stream ends** — all of them, and whether the stream ended cleanly, because the caller exited, or because the transport dropped. A peer left published after the caller is gone is something nobody can reach and nothing else will collect.
- **Persist no frames across a link drop.** A provider MUST NOT hold frames while the link is down and replay them when it returns. A replayed instruction arrives at a session that has moved on, and the caller cannot tell a replay from a fresh frame.
- **Put the announced session's `id` in `session` on every `peer` line it writes.** It is the same `id` the provider already returns for that session from `list` and `events`, and it MUST stay the same for as long as that session does — a provider that minted a fresh value per line, or per connection, would leave the caller unable to recognise one session across two announcements. This is the obligation the caller can least afford a provider to skip and least able to work around: without it the announcement resolves to no session the caller knows, so the peer is never published and the session is simply unreachable by name, while every other verb goes on working and nothing on the provider's side looks wrong.
- **Publish a peer record for each `peer` line, and remove it when that peer goes.** Whoever writes a record owns deleting it. A provider MUST publish under the publishing process's own identity in its host's *local* process domain, so that the host's own collector reclaims the record if the publisher dies. It MUST NOT publish under a foreign process domain in order to escape that collector: doing so keeps a record alive across the publisher's own death, which trades a transient orphan for a permanent one that nothing on that host can ever reclaim. This obligation is stated explicitly because the opposite is an attractive wrong turn — "nothing will reap us" reads as robustness and is the failure.
- **Publish the `name` from each `peer` line verbatim, and never publish two peers under one name.** The caller has already namespaced that name by the origin it declared in `hello`; a provider MUST NOT prefix, truncate, or otherwise rewrite it. A host that more than one caller bridges to is multi-tenant, and two callers would otherwise publish colliding names for sessions on different machines belonging to different people. A collision here is a misdelivery, not a display glitch. The caller composes the name rather than the provider because the naming rules are the caller's own — a provider would have to reimplement them to arrive at the same string, and publishing a given string is an obligation a caller can hold a provider to, where constructing one correctly is not. **On a collision the first name published wins and the second is refused.** A provider asked to publish a name it already publishes MUST leave the existing peer exactly as it is, MUST NOT publish the second, and MUST omit the refused handle from `peer-inventory`, where its absence reaches the caller as a handle it asked for that the provider does not publish. That omission is the whole report: nothing on this stream is acknowledged, so a refusal has no other channel, and a provider SHOULD additionally log it with both handles. Refusing the newcomer rather than displacing the incumbent is what keeps a working path working — the existing peer may already be carrying traffic, and a name that quietly changes which session it resolves to is exactly the misdelivery this rule exists to prevent, where a refused newcomer is merely unreachable and visible as such.
- **Pass message content byte-verbatim.** A provider MUST NOT rewrite, re-encode, truncate, annotate, or summarize the content of a frame it carries. Attribution is stamped by the receiving side from the handle the frame arrived on, so content that names a sender is claiming rather than proving one; a provider that edits content is altering the only part of a frame that is not reconstructed on arrival.
- **Never deliver a frame addressed to a handle it was not given.** Delivery is a lookup in the table the provider's own announcements built. A handle absent from it resolves to nothing and the frame is dropped and counted; a provider MUST NOT fall back to a name match, a nearest match, or a broadcast.

**Two connections can overlap, and that is the window the naming rule is written for.** A caller that sees this stream go silent past the limit terminates the process it spawned and dials again. The far side is on its own timer, counted from its own last activity rather than the caller's, and losing the transport is not the same event as noticing it is gone — so the previous connection's remote half can still be up, still publishing, when the next connection's opens. It is the ordinary consequence of a silence-driven reconnect rather than an exceptional failure, and nothing in the protocol coordinates the two: there is no takeover frame and no generation number, and a departing half may never learn its connection ended. The names both halves publish were composed by the caller from the same origin, which does not change across a reconnect, so what they publish collides exactly.

**A provider's remote half MUST therefore be mutually exclusive with itself, per caller origin, at the host rather than within one process.** The check that refuses a duplicate name has to be one two concurrently live halves can both see — a per-process table is the natural implementation and is precisely the one that fails here, because the process that would refuse the duplicate is not the process that published the original. When the check holds, the second half refuses under the rule above, the window closes on its own as soon as the older half notices its link is gone and unlinks what it published, and the cost is one refused handle visible as an inventory divergence. When it does not, two live publishers share one name and a message addressed by that name can reach the wrong one.

A caller cannot verify the replay and namespacing rules at all, and cannot see peers a provider leaves published on a host the caller has no access to. `peer-inventory` is the mitigation rather than a fix: the caller diffs the provider's claimed inventory against what it asked for and reports the difference, so a provider that declares `messages` and leaks is visible as a divergence rather than a mystery.

A provider that does not declare `messages` is never invoked for it and loses nothing else — its sessions remain fully usable through every other verb, and are simply not addressable by name. Failure to open the stream follows the standard error model below.

## Channel granularity

`events` is a **provider-level** stream, not a per-session one: a provider runs exactly one `events` connection that carries state for every session it knows about, and every `snapshot`/`session`/`removed` event on that single stream can reference any session the provider has. A caller opens one `events` connection per provider, full stop — never one per session.

`attach`, by contrast, is inherently **per-session**: one connection per session, opened only while a viewer pane is actually looking at that session, and closed the moment the viewer detaches.

The two verbs differ in granularity because what they carry differs in shape. A provider's aggregate session state — the kind of thing `list` and `events` report — is comparatively small and shared: one connection is enough to keep every session's state current, because that state is a summary. An interactive terminal is the opposite: a live, two-way byte stream tied to one human looking at one session, with no meaningful way to multiplex two people's keystrokes for two different sessions over a single channel. Opening one `events` stream per session — rather than the one-per-provider this contract specifies — multiplies connection count by session count for no benefit, which matters against transports with per-account connection limits and non-trivial per-connection cost.

`messages` falls on the `events` side of that division, and is specified one-per-provider for exactly the same reason: what it carries is aggregate, small, and shared across every session the provider knows about. That it is duplex does not move it — being two-way is not what forces `attach` to be per-session; being one human's interactive byte stream is.

## Error model

Every verb signals failure through its process exit code:

| Exit | Meaning | Expected caller behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | success | parse the result normally |
| 1 | permanent error | surface to the user; do not retry |
| 2 | usage/contract error | surface as a provider bug; log the full invocation |
| 3 | transient error | retry with backoff (bounded, e.g. up to 3 attempts for snapshot-style verbs) |
| 4 | auth needed | show a banner with remediation; pause further calls to this provider until one succeeds |

On a nonzero exit, the provider SHOULD emit one JSON error object on stdout:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "auth_expired",
    "message": "credentials expired for profile acme-mgmt",
    "retryable": false,
    "remediation": {"label": "Run example-provider login", "command": "example-provider login --profile acme-mgmt"}
  }
}
```

Well-known `code` values: `auth_expired`, `auth_missing`, `not_found`, `expired`, `already_exists`, `unreachable`, `invalid_params`, `credential_unresolvable`. Providers may return other codes; callers should treat unrecognized codes as opaque strings and still show `message`.

`expired` means the thing named existed and has since lapsed — `recall` returns it for a key the provider issued and has since aged out (see `recall` above). It is distinct from `not_found` because the two say different things to a human: `not_found` claims the identifier was never issued, which for a key a caller is holding a receipt for is simply false, and hides the fact that the record lapsed on a schedule the provider declared.

`credential_unresolvable` means a `credential_ref` in a `profile` object didn't resolve against the provider's own secret store. It's distinct from `invalid_params` because the remedy is provisioning — registering or fixing the secret on the provider side — not correcting the shape of the request. It carries the same `remediation` shape as any other code:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "credential_unresolvable",
    "message": "credential_ref \"acme-vault://oauth/acme-default\" not found in provider secret store",
    "retryable": false,
    "remediation": {"label": "Register credential in acme-vault", "command": "acme-provider credentials add acme-default"}
  }
}
```

If stdout on failure is not parseable JSON, the caller falls back to exit-code class plus the last few lines of stderr. On exit 4, a caller should present one actionable banner (for example, offering to run `remediation.command`) rather than a fresh error on every poll; any later invocation that succeeds clears that banner.

### Auth-needed state

The exit-4 row above is a per-invocation rule; this section specifies the state it puts the caller in, which the rest of the table doesn't need.

- **Auth-needed is a state of the PROVIDER, not of a session.** Exit class 4 from **any** verb — including `attach`, whose exit code is the only signal it has — means this provider cannot authenticate. It says nothing about whether any session is alive; per Identity & drift, only `list`/`events` speak to that.
- **Both signals count; neither overrides the other.** A caller classifies as auth-needed on the **union** of the two: exit class 4, **or** a parseable `code` of `auth_expired` / `auth_missing`. So a provider that exits 4 with a `code` the caller doesn't recognize (or with no parseable object at all) is auth-needed on the exit class, and a provider that exits 1 while naming `auth_expired` is auth-needed on the code, with its remediation intact. `credential_unresolvable` is **not** in this set: its remedy is provisioning, not re-authentication.
- **`remediation` is opaque.** A caller displays `label` and `command` verbatim and MAY offer to run the command, but MUST NOT interpret, parse, rewrite, or split it, and MUST NOT infer anything about the backend from it.
- **While auth-needed, keep polling.** "Pause further calls until one succeeds" (exit-4 row) means *stop starting new work* — in particular a caller SHOULD NOT spawn new `attach` processes, which would only die on connect. It does **not** mean going silent: the caller MUST keep its low-frequency `list` poll running, because that poll is the entire recovery mechanism. Pausing it would leave the state stuck until the user did something.
- **Recovery: the first subsequent SUCCESSFUL verb clears the state**, with no user gesture and nothing persisted. Auth-needed is runtime health only; it never survives across a caller restart on its own, it is simply rediscovered.

## Versioning

The contract version is a single integer major, exposed on every invocation as the `TBD_CONTRACT_VERSION` environment variable. The current major is **2**.

At registration, the caller invokes `describe`, intersects its own supported major versions with the provider's `contract_versions`, and picks the highest common value. If the intersection is empty, the caller refuses to use the provider and shows a clear error. Whatever major is chosen is what rides on every subsequent invocation via `TBD_CONTRACT_VERSION`.

**Major 2 adds no requirement over major 1.** It adds no required verb — it has one fewer, since `stop` is capability-gated — and every field it adds to an existing shape is optional with a defined reading when absent (`complete` reads as `true`, `archived` as `false`). A provider that conforms to major 1 therefore already conforms to major 2 without implementing anything new.

**Adopting major 2 is nevertheless a two-field edit to `describe`, and doing half of it loses a verb.** `stop` was required at major 1, so a caller negotiating 1 invokes it without consulting `capabilities`; at major 2 it is capability-gated like any other optional verb, and a caller MUST NOT invoke or offer an undeclared capability. A provider that adds `2` to `contract_versions` while leaving `stop` out of `capabilities` therefore keeps a working `stop` verb that no caller will ever call — the action silently disappears from the user's surface. **A provider that implements `stop` and declares major 2 MUST declare the `stop` capability alongside it.** Aside from that pairing, a v1 provider negotiating 2 sees exactly the behavior it saw at 1.

A provider that declares only `[1]` keeps working untouched, negotiated down to 1 by a caller that supports both.

The one asymmetry runs the other way: a provider that **drops** `stop` altogether no longer conforms to major 1, where it is required, and so MUST declare `contract_versions: [2]` rather than `[1, 2]`. Declaring a major means conforming to it, and a caller negotiating down to 1 against such a provider would be entitled to invoke a verb that no longer exists.

Within a major version: providers may add new response fields at any time — a scalar or a structured object alike, such as `pending_question` on the Session object — and callers MUST ignore fields they don't recognize. This is symmetric: callers may send new optional fields in structured stdin (for example, `profile` on `create`) that an older provider doesn't recognize, and **providers MUST likewise ignore fields they don't recognize in structured stdin** rather than fail on them — the same forward-compatibility contract applies in both directions. Removing or renaming a field, or changing the semantics of a verb, requires a new major version.

**A caller's silence is not confirmation.** That ignore-unknown-fields rule, read from the sending end, means an optional field a caller does not consume is dropped at decode rather than rejected: nothing is returned, nothing is logged on the sender's side, and a run in which a field was understood is indistinguishable from one in which it was never looked at. A provider therefore MUST NOT read the absence of an error, or the absence of any complaint at all, as evidence that a caller consumes a field it sends. Where this document states what TBD's own caller does with an optional field, that statement sits at the field; where it makes no such statement, a provider that needs to know has to ask the caller's implementers rather than infer it from a quiet run. Adding a new optional verb — gated behind a new entry in `capabilities`, as `rename`, `set-profile`, and `messages` were — is likewise additive within a major version: a caller that doesn't recognize the capability string simply never invokes the verb, so no version bump is needed for it either. **A provider declaring `contract_versions: [1]` may implement any capability-gated verb this document specifies, `messages` included.** The capability string is what admits a verb at either major — a caller invokes one because the provider declared it, never because a major was negotiated — and the optional response fields such a verb arrives with are readable at either major under the rule above. Declaring one therefore obliges nobody to add `2`, and adding `2` for a verb alone is the expensive mistake: it carries the `stop` pairing above with it. `messages` is the worked example of both halves at once: a capability-gated verb plus one optional response field (`peer_messaging`), added within major 2 and requiring no bump, no change to any existing verb, and nothing at all from a provider that declines it.

**`delete`, `retain`, `import`, `recall`, and `seed` are additive within major 2 on exactly those terms, and require no bump.** Four are capability-gated verbs, admitted by their capability strings the way `rename` and `messages` are; `seed` is a capability-gated field on `create`, admitted the way `profile` is. No required verb changes, no existing field is removed or renamed, and no existing verb's semantics move, so a provider that declares none of the five behaves precisely as it always has. **None of this changes `stop`'s status.** `delete`'s obligation to end a running session's compute is a statement about `delete` alone: it neither requires nor implies the `stop` capability, and the pairing rule above — a provider that implements `stop` and declares major 2 MUST declare the `stop` capability — is untouched by it.

## Identity & drift

- The provider mints session ids. An id MUST be opaque, unique within that provider, and durable across reboots of whatever the session runs on — derived from persisted state, not from a process id or an ephemeral index. The caller keys everything by the pair `(provider name, session id)`.
- The provider — via `list` and the `events` snapshot — is the source of truth for which sessions exist and their state. Any local record the caller keeps is a mirror, never authoritative.
- A session that is absent from **two consecutive** successful **complete** snapshots is considered gone by the caller — a distinct, visible state, not a silent deletion. A single absence is not enough to conclude this, since transports occasionally flake.
- **Incomplete snapshots (`complete: false`) never contribute to that conclusion.** Absence from a snapshot that never claimed to see everything is not evidence of anything: it does not advance a session toward `gone`, and it does not count as one of the two consecutive absences. Presence still counts for what it is worth — a session observed in an incomplete snapshot has been positively seen, so its accrued absences reset exactly as they would after a complete snapshot. An unbroken run of incomplete snapshots therefore leaves the mirror where it stands, neither retiring sessions nor refreshing the caller's freshness.
- An archived session is not a gone session. `archived: true` is a field on a session the provider still enumerates; `gone` is the caller's conclusion about a session the provider stopped enumerating. A caller MUST NOT collapse the two, and a provider MUST NOT produce the second when it means the first.
- If a caller observes a session id it has never seen before, it should adopt it — sessions created from elsewhere (another machine, or directly against the provider) are real and should be shown, not discarded.
- If the provider is unreachable, the caller's mirror goes stale-but-shown, with a staleness indicator. Unreachability of the provider is never equivalent to "the sessions are dead" — those are independent facts.
