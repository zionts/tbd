"""Comment-body renderer for the claude-review-v2 pipeline.

Owns the construction of the review comment each full-review run posts
(docs/specs/2026-08-03-pr-review-fanout-design.md §3.5). The workflow calls it
and pipes stdout into the body file; posting the comment — and minimizing the
PR's earlier v2 reviews as outdated — stays in the workflow shell.

The body it renders is one review comment carrying its own machine-read state:
the three marker lines, the model's `comment_body` prose (or a machine-rendered
fallback when that prose is missing), then the attribution line. The next run's
prepare step reads its markers back off the newest such comment.

Invariants every rendered body holds:

- the three marker lines are the first three lines, in a fixed order,
- sections are separated by exactly one blank line,
- model prose is emitted verbatim — never interpolated into a shell command,
  never pattern-matched, never rewritten,
- rendering NEVER fails: unreadable or malformed input yields a valid degraded
  body plus a warning on stderr, which the workflow surfaces as `::warning::`.
  The step's pass/fail is governed by validate.py, never by this script.

All policy lives in pure functions (no clock, no subprocess, no network — every
input is a parameter); main() is the only I/O shell. Python 3 stdlib only.

# --- sentinel ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Opens every review comment body this pipeline posts. The workflow selects its
# prior reviews — to read state off the newest and to minimize them all as
# outdated — by matching the App's comments whose body STARTS WITH this line, so
# it must stay line 1.
#
# DO NOT RENAME IT. The literal still reads "v2" from when this pipeline ran
# alongside the single-session reviewer it has since replaced, and that is now
# purely a name: it is live state, matched verbatim by the workflow's jq
# selectors — when it fetches the prior comment and when it minimizes priors —
# and stamped into every review comment already on every open PR. (prepare.py
# never sees the sentinel; it parses the marker lines below out of the comment
# those selectors already picked.) Changing it orphans those comments — priors
# stop being found and collapsed, and skip decisions read no prior state and
# silently re-review.
