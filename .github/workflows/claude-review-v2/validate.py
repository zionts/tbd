"""Validate step for the claude-review-v2 pipeline.

Deterministic bookend that runs AFTER the model review session
(docs/specs/2026-08-03-pr-review-fanout-design.md §3.2, §3.4, §3.5). It:

- schema-validates every specialist findings file and the merged review-result,
- with `--expected-specialists`, checks that every named specialist actually
  produced a VALID findings file (a partial fan-out must never read as a clean
  run), reporting separately whether a lens produced nothing at all or produced
  a file the schema rejected,
- checks the disposition list COVERS every specialist finding ID (presence only —
  the disposition's judgment is never evaluated here, spec §3.4),
- computes the verdict from the merged findings' severities (the model never
  types the verdict) and writes it to verdict.txt.

Any validation failure or uncovered finding exits non-zero: the gate fails
closed. Pure policy functions take plain data; main() is the only I/O shell.

`jsonschema` (pip-installed in CI) is imported lazily inside the validation
functions so the pure functions — and prepare.py — never need it.
