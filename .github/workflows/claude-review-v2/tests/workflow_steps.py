"""Pull one step's shell body out of the PR-review workflow, BY STEP NAME.

The workflow's "Post review comment and enforce verdict" step implements
safety-shaped ordering in shell — the verdict gate before anything is posted,
the minimize sweep before the post, the REJECT exit after it — and shell that
nothing executes is correct only by inspection. These helpers extract a named
step's `run:` block so a test can run it under bash against a stubbed `gh`.

Lookup is by EXACT step name and raises when the name is absent: renaming a
step fails the tests loudly rather than silently leaving them asserting on
nothing.

The parse is deliberately literal rather than a YAML load: these helpers hand a
step's shell to bash and assert on its verbatim source, comments included, and a
load discards exactly that. (Where a test needs to know what GitHub itself would
see — which job names a workflow declares — `test_workflow_structure.py` uses a
real parser instead, because there a pattern match can be evaded.) Steps are the
`- name:` entries at the shallowest such indentation in the file (this workflow
has one job), and a run body is the block scalar under `run: |`.

Not a test module — pytest does not collect it.
