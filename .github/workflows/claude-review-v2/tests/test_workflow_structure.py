"""Structural assertions on the v2 review workflow's step graph.

Two properties here are positional rather than behavioral, so a shell harness
cannot see them and only the workflow's own shape can:

- the pipeline directory is re-restored from the base branch AFTER the review
  session and BEFORE the steps that compute and publish the verdict. The
  session holds an unrestricted Write tool, so validate.py (which computes the
  verdict) and render_comment.py (which builds text posted verbatim to a public
  PR) must be re-established after that window closes.
- both restores materialize the same tree, because the second reads the SHA the
  first resolved and recorded rather than FETCH_HEAD, which a later fetch moves.

Every lookup is by exact step NAME, so renaming a step fails loudly.
