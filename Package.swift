        // Pinned to a TBD fork of an upstream main-branch revision. Main
        // branch, because no tagged release contains upstream's display-link
        // frame scheduler: through v1.20.0, SwiftTerm repaints via
        // `queuePendingDisplay()`, which coalesces damage behind a fixed
        // `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(+16.67ms)` — a floor on key-to-paint
        // latency rather than a rate limit, and one TBD measured in the
        // field. Upstream `main` deletes that mechanism outright
        // (`queuePendingDisplay`, `pendingDisplay`, `displayImmediately`,
        // `scheduleDisplay(immediate:)` are all gone) in favour of a
        // `FrameDriver` on `CADisplayLink`/`CVDisplayLink`
        // (`Sources/SwiftTerm/Apple/FrameDriver.swift`), and moves the macOS
        // Metal layer's rendering off the main thread. TBD runs many
        // streaming TUI terminals at once — the load upstream issue #658
        // describes — so the main-thread cost of the old scheduler is ours to
        // carry. A fork, because SwiftTerm 2.0 removed `getTerminal()` from
        // the public surface without giving view embedders any public route
        // to the `Terminal` — `TerminalView.withTerminal(_:caller:)`, the
        // self-locking accessor TBD needs for OSC state reads and mouse
        // encoding, is internal upstream. The pinned revision is upstream
        // `9c2518e` plus one commit (branch `tbd/public-with-terminal`)
        // making `withTerminal` public. Once upstream merges an equivalent
        // accessor, re-pin to upstream and delete the fork; once a tagged
        // release contains both, switch back to `from:`.
        //
        // A frame loop that does not run on the main thread may never call
        // `viewWillDraw()`, which TBD's terminal diagnostics hook. Diagnostics
        // going quiet is expected on this revision, not a regression.
        //
        // RE-VERIFIED for 9c2518e (2026-08-28): ChildReaper STAYS, unchanged.
        // `LocalProcess` was substantially rewritten on this revision (locked
        // session state, a `TerminalIOPipeline` read path), but `waitpid` is
        // still called from exactly one place in the whole package —
        // `processTerminated()` at `LocalProcess.swift:384`, reachable only
        // from the `DispatchSourceProcess` `.exit` handler
        // (`LocalProcess.swift:589`). Neither teardown path TBD uses reaps:
        // `deinit` (`:356`) and `terminate()` (`:604`) both take the session
        // resources and cancel the monitor (`:358`, `:620`) with no `waitpid`,
        // and `terminate()` now cancels *before* it sends `SIGTERM` (`:624`),
        // so the exit event is even less likely to fire than it was.
        //
        // Re-verify again on the next bump, because the reason ChildReaper
        // exists is a property of the pinned revision: upstream reaps only
        // from its `DispatchSourceProcess` (`.exit`) handler, and both
        // `deinit` and `terminate()` cancel that source before the child
        // actually exits — so TBD must reap the PTY child itself. If a later
        // revision reaps its own children, `ChildReaper` becomes a competing
        // waiter on a pid the OS may have recycled, which is worse than the
        // leak it fixes. Its doc comment names the exact lines to re-read.
