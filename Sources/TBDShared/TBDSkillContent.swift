description: Drive TBD (a macOS worktree + terminal manager). Use when the user asks to create a worktree, spawn a Claude, Codex, or shell session in another tab, send input to a terminal, read terminal output, link to a worktree, or send a UI notification — or whenever running inside a TBD-managed terminal (TBD_WORKTREE_ID env var is set).
---

# TBD

TBD is a macOS app that manages git worktrees and terminal tabs (Claude Code, Codex, or shell). Sessions running inside a TBD-managed terminal have `TBD_WORKTREE_ID` set in env.

## When to use this skill

- The user asks to spawn an agent, create a new worktree, send a message to another terminal, or notify the UI.
- You're running inside TBD (`TBD_WORKTREE_ID` is set) and need to coordinate with the user's other tabs.

## Discovering current commands

Always run `tbd <subcommand> --help` for current flags — flag detail is not duplicated here. Top-level commands: `tbd worktree`, `tbd terminal`, `tbd panel`, `tbd link`, `tbd notify`.

## Common workflows

### Spawn a new agent tab in the current worktree

New sessions you spawn start with NO conversation history. Brief them like a colleague who just walked into the room.

```bash
tbd terminal create "$TBD_WORKTREE_ID" --type claude --prompt-file - <<'EOF'
Goal, what you've ruled out, file paths/lines, enough surrounding context
that the new session can make judgment calls rather than follow narrow steps.
EOF
```

Use `--type codex` to spawn Codex instead of Claude:

```bash
tbd terminal create "$TBD_WORKTREE_ID" --type codex --prompt-file - <<'EOF'
Goal, what you've ruled out, file paths/lines, enough surrounding context
that the new session can make judgment calls rather than follow narrow steps.
EOF
```

### Create a new worktree with an initial task

```bash
tbd worktree create --prompt-file - <<'EOF'
briefing here
EOF
```

**Where the new branch starts:** `tbd worktree create` always bases the new branch on the repo's **default branch from origin**, never on the caller's branch. It best-effort `git fetch`es, then branches off `origin/<default>` (e.g. `origin/main`), falling back to the local `<default>` only if the remote ref is missing. `--position` (child/sibling/root) controls only where the worktree sits in the UI tree — never the git base. So a worker spawned from a feature branch still starts clean off `origin/main`; to build on unmerged work, land that work on the default branch first (then rebase the new worktree onto it).

### Spawn worker worktrees from an orchestrator (most common fan-out)

The default `--position=child` nests the new worktree under the caller. This
is what you want when an orchestrator is fanning out a batch of workers —
they'll all be siblings of each other and children of the orchestrator.

```bash
tbd worktree create --branch tbd/<task> --name "<task>" --prompt-file - <<'EOF'
briefing here
EOF
```

Use `--position=sibling` when you (the caller) are *already* a worker under
some parent and you want to spawn a peer alongside yourself — not when you
want to spawn workers under yourself.

Use `--position=root` to force the new worktree to be top-level.
Remember all three positions only affect UI-tree placement — every new worktree branches off the default branch regardless (see above).

### Reparent a worktree

Move an existing worktree under a different orchestrator, or promote a child
to top-level. `--index` is optional and defaults to the end of the destination
sibling group.

```bash
tbd worktree reparent <worktree> --parent <name-or-id> [--index N]
tbd worktree reparent <worktree> --root [--index N]
```

### Send input to an existing terminal / read its output

```bash
tbd terminal send --terminal <id> --text "..." [--submit]
tbd terminal output <id> [--lines N]
```

**A session someone has open answers from a frozen screen.** While a viewer
holds a session's pty, `tbd terminal output` still answers: with the daemon's
emulator as it stood when that viewer attached, and it announces that
on stderr. Stdout stays exactly the screen text, so a reader that captures only
stdout cannot tell a live screen from one that stopped updating hours ago. Read
the stderr note, or pass `--json` and check `screen.source` (`daemon` is the
live store, `staleDaemon` the at-attach one) and `screen.ageMilliseconds`,
before acting on what you read.

`screen` is there only for sessions on the pty-holder transport. A tmux-backed
session answers with `output` alone, so a missing `screen` key means a tmux
session rather than an error, and there is no staleness question to ask about
one — tmux captures its pane live.

### Message a sibling session

Two channels reach another TBD session.

If `ListAgents` and `SendMessage` are among your tools, sibling sessions on this
machine should show up in `ListAgents` — registration is best-effort, so a
running session can be missing — and `SendMessage` hands one plain text,
delivered between the recipient's turns. Each row carries a name, a short
`[ref]`, its kind and its status; TBD-spawned rows also carry a tmux pane. TBD
sets a session's peer name from the worktree display name at spawn, so rows
usually match the sidebar — but two things pull them apart. A session spawned
before the running daemon supported naming carries the
working-directory slug plus a short suffix instead. And a worktree renamed
after a session started leaves that session on its spawn-time name, because the
name is fixed at spawn and a new one applies only at the next respawn or
resume.

So a `No agent named 'X' is reachable.` refusal usually means the peer is
listed under a different name, not that it is dead — do not conclude a session
is gone from a failed send. Identify its row by the tmux pane instead:
every TBD-spawned row prints `tmux <server>:<window>.<pane>`, and
`tbd terminal list <worktree-id>` prints that worktree's own window and pane, so
the two join whatever the row is named. `tbd worktree list --json` is where the
worktree id and the directory slug come from.
`tbd peer list` does that join for you — every peer TBD can see, with the
worktree, terminal or remote session behind it.

Address a peer you have not messaged before as `name [ref]`:
a bare name may be refused with an error naming the ref you need, even when
only one row answers to it, and the ref is also how you pick when several rows
share a name (several terminals in one worktree do, and so can worktrees in
different repos). Once a message to that peer has gone through, its bare name
works. Refs belong to live sessions — re-read `ListAgents` instead of reusing
an old listing. If those tools aren't there, use `tbd terminal send`.

`tbd terminal send` / `tbd terminal output` (above) is the daemon-mediated
channel: it works from any harness, and it can also drive input into a
session's composer rather than only handing it a message.

### Pin / unpin a terminal

Pin a terminal to keep it docked and quickly reachable; unpin to remove it from the dock.

```bash
tbd terminal pin <id>
tbd terminal unpin <id>
```

### Pull the user's attention to a worker's tab

Use when an orchestrator wants the user to look at a specific child tab (e.g. a
worker needs input). Default is a **soft push** — a banner + an unread mark on
that worktree; the user lands on the tab when they choose to look. It does NOT
steal focus.

```bash
tbd terminal focus --terminal <id> [--message "..."]
```

Add `--activate` ONLY when the user has explicitly asked to be taken there — it
foregrounds the app and switches to the tab immediately, interrupting whatever
they're doing:

```bash
tbd terminal focus --terminal <id> --activate
```

Get `<id>` from `tbd terminal list <worktree>` or the output of `tbd terminal create`.

### Notify the TBD UI

```bash
tbd notify --type {response_complete|error|task_complete|attention_needed} --message "..."
```

### Get a deep link to a worktree

```bash
tbd link [<worktree>]   # no arg = current
```

### Pull requests

A worktree can own several PRs. TBD binds them automatically (from `gh pr create`
and from branch matching); manage the list when that is wrong.

- `tbd pr list` — PRs bound to this worktree
- `tbd pr attach <number|url>` — bind a PR TBD did not find
- `tbd pr detach <number|url>` — unbind a PR that no longer belongs

A detached PR stays detached — automatic discovery will not re-add it. Auto-archive
waits for every bound PR to merge or close, so detaching one stale PR is how you
unblock it. Do **not** detach every PR to *suppress* auto-archive: a worktree with
no bound PRs falls back to archiving on the next merge it observes. Turn
auto-archive off for the worktree instead.

## Panels

Each worktree tab has a **primary** anchor (its terminal, or a file/web/note/transcript) plus an optional layout tree of **viewer panels** beside it.

### See

```bash
tbd panel list "$TBD_WORKTREE_ID"
```

Read-only and always available regardless of gating. Prints each tab's primary content plus its layout tree, including the **panelID**/**splitID** of every node — these are the handles Arrange commands target. Add `--tab <id>` to inspect one tab, `--json` for the raw result.

### Arrange

`open`, `navigate`, `close`, `move`, `resize`, `back`, `forward`, `jump`, `select-tab` rearrange panels in your own worktree — split a file open beside the terminal, swap what a panel shows, step through a panel's history, or switch the active tab. Run `tbd panel <verb> --help` for flags; most target a `--tab` plus a `--panel` or `--split` ID from `tbd panel list`.

Terminals are **never** viewer panels — they only ever appear as a tab's primary anchor, so `open`/`navigate` content is always file, web, transcript, or note.

### Gating

Arrange requires the daemon's panel-surface flags, which default OFF during the current soak. If disabled, the command prints the daemon's error naming the flag and exits non-zero — ask the user to enable it rather than retrying. `list` works regardless.

## Scratch spaces & promotion

A **scratch space** is a repo-less TBD workspace (`~/tbd/scratch/<name>`) with no
git repo. Use `tbd scratch new` to make one, `tbd scratch list` to list them.

When a scratch project takes shape, offer the user promotion: ask for a
destination path, then run `tbd scratch promote <dest-path>` from a session
inside the scratch space. Promotion requires the scratch directory to be a git
repository with at least one commit — run `git init` and make an initial commit
before promoting. Promotion then moves the folder to the destination and
registers it as a real TBD repo. Add `--display-name <name>` to override the
repo name. Do not `git init` and leave it a scratch space forever — promotion
is the graduation path.

## Briefing requirements when spawning sessions

Always include:
- What you're trying to accomplish.
- What you've already tried or ruled out.
- Relevant file paths with line numbers.
- Enough context for the new session to make judgment calls, not just follow narrow steps.

Use `--prompt-file -` with a heredoc to avoid shell escaping issues.

## Env vars set in TBD-managed terminals

- `TBD_WORKTREE_ID` — current worktree UUID.
- `TBD_PROMPT_CONTEXT` — short context hint confirming you're inside a TBD-managed session. The full `tbd` skill is loaded by your harness when supported; other harnesses may fall back to reading `~/Library/Application Support/TBD/skill/SKILL.md`.
- `TBD_PROMPT_INSTRUCTIONS` — per-repo custom instructions (if configured).

## Outside a TBD terminal

If `TBD_WORKTREE_ID` isn't set, run `tbd worktree list` to find an ID, or `tbd worktree create` to make one. The CLI works from any shell on the same machine as the TBD daemon.
