/// Accumulates a Claude session transcript from JSONL lines delivered in
/// arbitrary chunks, producing exactly what `TranscriptParser.parse` would
/// produce over the concatenation of those chunks.
///
/// Two facts make this possible, and both are load-bearing:
///
/// 1. `TranscriptParser.buildItems` is a pure function of the lines handed to
///    it — every item is derivable from its own row. So lines that arrive
///    later can be built in isolation and appended.
/// 2. The single exception is `toolResultsByID`. A `tool_use` resolves its
///    result from a `user` line that arrives LATER, so an append-only
///    implementation leaves such tool cards permanently unresolved. Ingest
///    therefore patches already-built items when their result finally lands.
///
/// Raw line dictionaries are deliberately not retained. Holding every parsed
/// `[String: Any]` for a large session would cost more memory than this design
/// saves in transfer; only the built items, the result index, the rows of tool
/// calls that might still be patched, and the two message-id sets are kept.
///
/// `assistantMessageIDs` and `assistantTextMessageIDs` are the retained sets
/// with no upper bound of their own: each holds one short API `message.id`
/// string per distinct assistant message and never removes one, so they grow
/// with the length of the session. Nothing prunes them — the whole struct is
/// dropped when `TranscriptSource.forget` runs for the session, which is what
/// bounds them.
