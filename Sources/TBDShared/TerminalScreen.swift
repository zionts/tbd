/// What a machine reader is told when it asks a session what is on its screen.
///
/// `terminal.output` used to answer with a bare `String`, and a string cannot
/// carry the two facts every consumer's policy turns on: **which store
/// answered**, and **how stale that store's view is**. A consumer reading text
/// alone cannot tell a live render from a frozen one, so it cannot have a
/// policy at all — it can only hope. Those two facts are `source` and
/// `ageMilliseconds`, and they are why this is a type rather than a string.
///
/// The second reason is the whitelist. Every cell that reaches `lines` is
/// printable or a tab: a never-written cell is projected as a space by the
/// render, the trailing half of a wide glyph is omitted, and every other
/// disallowed scalar is projected as `U+FFFD`. The render does that against
/// `isDisallowed`, the same predicate the initializer checks with, so the two
/// cannot disagree about what a screen line may hold.
///
/// **The render substitutes; the initializer refuses.** A child may legitimately
/// store a `DEL` or a C1 byte in a cell — SwiftTerm's ground-state fast path
/// keeps them verbatim — so refusing those at construction would make one
/// `printf '\x7f'` break every later read of the session until the line left
/// scrollback. Substituting at the render keeps the whitelist true without
/// making a session's own output able to silence it. What survives to the
/// initializer is therefore a *projection bug* rather than anything a session
/// can do: a render that forgot the predicate, or a producer that never ran
/// one. A bug is better raised at the boundary than shipped to a consumer that
/// matches on text and silently fails to find the characters on either side of
/// the hole. (1,595 `U+0000` cells were measured across five of nine live
/// sessions in one sweep, and no consumer had noticed.)
