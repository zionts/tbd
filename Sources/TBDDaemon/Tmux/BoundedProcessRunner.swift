/// from that same pool, so a "dedicated queue" would not have helped. Under the

/// with none free, the 100ms timer handler never ran, a `sleep 3` child ran to
/// natural completion, and the call was reported as a clean success 30x past its
/// deadline. This thread is created explicitly and blocks only in
/// `NSCondition.wait`, so it is always available to run a deadline action on
/// time regardless of pool saturation.
///
/// The thread owns a deadline-ordered set of pending entries; `schedule` appends
/// one (waking the thread), `cancel` removes one. Actions run OFF the condition
/// lock, so an action may re-enter `schedule`/`cancel` — the SIGTERM→SIGKILL
/// escalation does exactly that.

/// it is not merged, so a caller passing a partial dict gets a child missing

/// hypothetically large `stdin` (bigger than the pipe buffer, with a child
/// that doesn't drain concurrently) would block the CALLING thread until the
/// child reads enough to make room, the same way an undrained large stdout
/// would block the child.
///
/// `stdio` defaults to `.pipes`, which is exactly what every call site got
/// before the parameter existed. `.pseudoTerminal` swaps the two pipes for one
/// `openpty(3)` pair — for a child that refuses to run unless its stdout is a
/// terminal — and is deliberately opt-in per invocation: the two output streams
/// merge onto that single descriptor, so the reported `stderr` is always empty
/// and a `stdin` payload is REFUSED rather than silently hanging (there is no
/// separate write end to close). See `BoundedProcessStdio`.
///
/// The deadline is immune to GCD-pool starvation via two independent guarantees:
///
/// 1. SCHEDULING — the deadline AND the SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation fire on the
///    dedicated `SubprocessWatchdog` thread, never on a GCD queue. The fire path
///    (claim guard → SIGTERM → schedule the SIGKILL escalation → hand the
///    snapshot to the caller → resume) runs on that thread with no GCD hop
///    before the continuation resumes.
///
///    **Every step of that path is non-blocking, and that is a property of the
///    mechanism rather than of any one call.** One thread fires every bounded
///    deadline in the daemon, so work that can wait on something there does not
///    delay one call — it stops `GitManager`, `TmuxManager`, `ProviderRunner`
///    and every completion probe from ever seeing their deadlines, and it stops
///    the SIGKILL escalation this action just queued behind itself, which is the
///    very thing that would have unblocked it. The snapshot is the one step that
///    can wait: it acquires the accumulator lock, which a drain worker holds
///    across a blocking read on a pipe whose write end the child — or a
///    grandchild that inherited it — still holds. So the action hands the
///    snapshot to the task that is already awaiting this call (`DeferredWork`)
///    and that task runs it after being resumed. A wedged drain can then hold up
///    the one call that owns it and nothing else.
///
///    The pty path never had this exposure, because it sets `O_NONBLOCK` on the
///    primary at creation. The pipe path cannot follow it there: its drain goes
///    through `availableData`, which turns a read errno into an Objective-C
///    exception Swift cannot catch (the reason `readAvailableRaw` exists at
///    all). Structure, not ordering, is what closes the hazard for both.
///
/// 2. AUTHORITY — the completion path records a monotonic start instant and, if
///    the child's exit is observed only AFTER the full deadline elapsed, reports
///    `.timedOut` regardless of exit status. The timeout bounds the CALL, not
///    merely the child: a completion delayed past the deadline is a lie if
///    reported as a clean success, so it is reported as a timeout. Production
///    timeouts are >=5s, so this only ever triggers under the extreme starvation
///    that made the report a lie in the first place.
///
/// Both pipes are drained incrementally via `readabilityHandler` while the child
/// runs — a macOS pipe buffer is 64KB, so a child emitting more (e.g. `ps -Ao`
/// on a busy machine, ~72KB) would otherwise block writing to the full pipe
/// while we wait for it to exit — a mutual deadlock resolved only by the
/// timeout. The drain never waits for pipe EOF: any spawned process can fork
/// background grandchildren that inherit the pipe write ends, so EOF may
/// never arrive after the direct child dies.
/// Termination, timeout, and spawn-failure all snapshot what has already arrived
/// and close the parent read ends — no thread, FD, or closure outlives the call.
///
/// The continuation is guarded by a `ContinuationGuard` so exactly one of
/// {termination, timeout, spawn-failure} resumes it, satisfying the single-resume
/// contract even when the process exits concurrently with the watchdog.
///
/// `clock` is the standard behavior seam (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`, "Clock and date
/// seams"): it arms the deadline a *second* time so tests can drive it in
/// virtual time, and it deliberately does **not** replace the watchdog. Moving
/// the deadline onto the cooperative executor would reinstate the starvation bug
/// the watchdog exists to fix — `SubprocessTimeoutStarvationTests` is that
/// property's regression guard and passes a real clock on purpose.
///
/// Note the AUTHORITY check below stays on the concrete `ContinuousClock`. A
/// time reference whose job is to detect that the time *mechanism* failed must
/// not be virtualized, or both halves lie in the same direction. It is also the
/// one piece of `Instant` arithmetic here, which `any Clock<Duration>` cannot
/// express — a constraint that costs nothing because this line must not move.
/// `beforeDeadlineSnapshot` is a test-only seam, defaulted so no call site
/// changes. It runs immediately before the deadline path's snapshot, *wherever
/// that snapshot runs* — which is the whole point: a test that blocks in it
/// blocks the caller's own task under the structure above, and would block the
/// shared watchdog thread under the structure this replaced. That difference is
/// what `BoundedProcessRunnerTests`'
/// `aSecondDeadlineIsServedWhileAnotherCallsSnapshotIsWedged` observes without
/// comparing any wall clock: with the snapshot held, a *second* bounded call
