/// Generates and maintains the TBD-owned Claude Code settings overlay file.
///
/// Claude Code's `--settings <path>` flag merges array settings (like the
/// `hooks` dict's matchers) with the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` —
/// concatenated and deduplicated, not replaced. That means TBD can ship
/// its own overlay file pinned at spawn time without touching the user's
/// settings.json at all.
///
/// The overlay registers eight event types:
/// - `SessionStart` (matcher `*`): calls `tbd session-event`, which
///   relays the new session ID + transcript path to the daemon. This is
///   what fixes the post-`/clear`/`/compact` transcript freeze. Also
///   sets the terminal activity state to idle.
/// - `Stop` (two entries):
///   - `tbd notify` for response-complete notifications, matching the
///     legacy globally-installed hook. Also sets activity to idle.
///   - `tbd hooks stop-rename-check`, which prompts the agent to rename
///     a still-default worktree/branch at end-of-turn.
/// - `StopFailure`: runs `tbd hooks stop-failure` to read the verbatim
///   API-error text from the transcript, then pipes that into
///   `tbd notify --type error` — `Stop` fires only on normal completion.
///   Also sets activity to idle.
/// - `UserPromptSubmit`: sets activity to working so the thinking
///   indicator appears in the sidebar while Claude processes a prompt.
/// - `PreToolUse:AskUserQuestion` / `PostToolUse:AskUserQuestion`:
///   bridge tool input and `tool_use_id` so the transcript pane can
///   render the question before Claude flushes the assistant message
///   to the JSONL. Pre sets activity to waiting_for_user; post sets
///   it back to working (Claude continues processing after user answers).
/// - `PostToolUse:Bash`: greps the payload for `pr create` and, only on
///   a match, pipes it to `tbd pr bind --from-hook` to bind any PR the
///   command reported. The grep prefilter keeps every other Bash call
///   (the overwhelming majority) from spawning a `tbd` process. It is a
///   cost optimization, not a gate — `PRBindingExtractor`'s tokenizer
///   decides what actually counts as a create.
/// - `Notification` (no matcher): runs `tbd hooks notification`, which
///   forwards the payload verbatim so the daemon can record a structured
///   reason an agent is waiting.
/// - `SessionEnd` (no matcher): runs `tbd session-end`, which drops any
///   standing delegation claim for the terminal. A session that exits
///   while background subagents are live leaves a final `turn_duration`
///   record still reporting them, and no later turn corrects it.
///

/// shape (new hooks, new commands) take effect on the next worktree open.

    /// excluded and so the run can never cross a word.

    /// implied: a flag word *between* the two subcommand words
    /// (`gh pr --draft create`, `glab mr -R acme/acme-prod create`), which the
    /// tokenizer skips over but which no pattern can span without also matching
    /// ordinary prose — the intervening flag and its value are alphanumeric
