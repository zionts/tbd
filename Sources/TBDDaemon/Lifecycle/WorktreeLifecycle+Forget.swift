    /// Removes a worktree from TBD's tracking **without** deleting the directory
    /// from disk. Contrast with `archiveWorktree`, which runs `git worktree
    /// remove --force` and deletes the folder. `forget` deliberately skips that
    /// git removal so the folder and its files (including uncommitted and
    /// gitignored content like `.context`) stay exactly in place.
    ///
    /// What `forget` does (mirrors the archive/reconcile cleanup, minus the disk
    /// removal and the archive hook):
    /// 1. Inserts a `forgotten_worktree` tombstone for the path (see below).
    /// 2. Kills the worktree's tmux windows.
    /// 3. Deletes its terminals + tabs and clears their pending questions and
    ///    per-session ClaudeHookOverlay files.
    /// 4. Hard-deletes the worktree row (so it's gone from BOTH the active and
    ///    archived lists — not merely flipped to `.archived`).
    ///
    /// What `forget` does NOT do:
    /// - It does not call `git.worktreeRemove` (the directory survives).
    /// - It does not run the `archive` lifecycle hook ("before_worktree_remove"),
    ///   because nothing is being removed from disk.
    ///
    /// Reconcile re-adoption is suppressed via a tombstone: `reconcile`
    /// re-adopts on-disk git worktrees whose path is under one of TBD's own
    /// prefixes (`~/tbd/worktrees/<slot>/` or `<repo>/.tbd/worktrees/`), so
    /// `forget` also inserts a `forgotten_worktree` tombstone row keyed by the
    /// worktree's absolute path. Reconcile skips tombstoned paths, making
    /// forget stick even for TBD-managed locations. The tombstone is cleared
    /// when the user deliberately re-adds the path (adopt or create), which
    /// restores normal reconcile behavior.
