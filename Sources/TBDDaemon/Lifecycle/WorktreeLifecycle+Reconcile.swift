/// holder is gone" are different facts and only the second is evidence. The two
/// failure shapes collapse into one `keep` here — this sweep asks once, and the
/// next reconcile is the retry — but they keep their reasons apart in the log.
/// The **whole-pass** bound on how long the holder arm may spend at
/// rendezvous sockets, and the reason a per-probe timeout is not one.
///
/// A per-holder receive timeout bounds one probe; a serial phase over N rows
/// costs N times that bound, and this arm runs inside
/// `performStartupReconciliation` — before the socket is bound, holding a tmux
/// server resource lock. That is the failure `HolderRegistry.adoptAllBudget`
/// exists to prevent, and this is the same mechanism applied at the same place
/// in startup: a timer flips one flag, the loop reads it before each probe, and
/// a pass that runs out keeps every row it has not reached. Keeping is free —
/// this sweep asks once and the next reconcile *is* the retry — so an unreached
/// row loses nothing but a pass.
///
/// It bounds the pass, not a probe: the real cost is the budget plus the one
/// round trip in flight when it expired, exactly as `adoptAllBudget`'s is. That
/// round trip is bounded by its receive timeout alone, because the
/// `Darwin.connect` opening it cannot wait on a listener — on Darwin an
/// `AF_UNIX` connect is answered or refused outright, never queued behind a
/// listener that has stopped accepting.
///
/// An actor because one `WorktreeLifecycle` value is copied per call and every
/// copy must read the same flag — the same reason `conflictSweepCache` is one.

    /// Every gate fails toward keeping, and the order is the argument:
    ///
    ///   1. **No registry, no opinion.** A daemon with no `HolderRegistry`
    ///      (mock mode, a test that does not exercise the transport) knows
    ///      nothing about holders and may not judge their rows.
    ///   2. **A viewer owning the pty ends it.** After `confirmAttach` the app
    ///      holds the descriptor and the daemon has no reader at all, so the
    ///      probes below would be asking about a session somebody is looking
    ///      at.
    ///   3. **A live reader ends it.** The daemon is draining this pty right
    ///      now. That stays true after the job exits, deliberately: a drained
    ///      screen is a readable gravestone, exactly as an owned dead tmux pane
    ///      is on the other arm, and it is released by
    ///      `reclaimIfSessionEnded` rather than by this sweep.
    ///   4. **A terminal status already recorded ends the questioning.** A
    ///      holder winds itself down the moment an answer carrying the status
    ///      reaches a client, so once one has there is nobody left to ask.
    ///   5. **Otherwise, ask the rendezvous — and *what* is asked depends on
    ///      whether this daemon has ever taken the master.** A row the registry
    ///      remembers as `.alive` was handed over, so a `describe` costs it
    ///      nothing and gives a real exit code. A row it remembers nothing
    ///      about may still be a holder sitting on output nobody has drained,
    ///      and describing it would collect the exit, wind the holder down and
    ///      destroy exactly the screen the handover exists to preserve — so
    ///      that row gets `holderListenerVerdict`, which asks nothing.
    ///
    /// Every probe is additionally under the pass's `HolderProbeBudget`: gates
    /// 1-4 are dictionary reads and always run, and a pass that has spent its
    /// budget keeps the rest rather than opening more sockets before the
    /// daemon's own is bound.
    ///
    /// The last gate is the one that is not about the holder at all. **A row
    /// whose job is still running is kept even when its holder is provably
    /// gone**, because that row is the only record of the child pid, and
    /// `AgentReaper.sweepHolderChildren` — the named reconciler for a job whose
    /// holder died — reads exactly that record. Deleting the row here would
    /// reclaim an inventory entry and strand the process it named, which is the
    /// hazard `HolderRegistry.killJob`'s doc comment describes. So this sweep
    /// signals nothing, ever.
    ///
    /// **Naming that contingency honestly: the loop does not always close.**
    /// The reaper keeps rather than signals whenever identity is uncertain —
    /// `holder-unrecorded`, `start-time-mismatch`, `foreign-executable` — and
    /// each of those is a permanent keep here too. A pid the row names that has been reused by a
    /// stranger therefore keeps the row indefinitely instead of killing that
    /// stranger. That is the direction to fail in, and a kept row is a visible
    /// session the user can close by hand.
