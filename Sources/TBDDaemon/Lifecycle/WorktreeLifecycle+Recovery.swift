    /// The pre-session phase-3 wait lives in an in-memory detached task; when
    /// the daemon dies mid-wait the row stays `.creating` forever — reconcile

    /// requires `.archived`, so nothing else can ever resolve it. Call this at
    /// startup BEFORE the per-repo reconcile loop.

    /// Per `.creating` row:
    /// - Remote row → mark it `.failed`; see the guard below.
    /// - Checkout missing on disk → creation never completed; delete the row
    ///   (and its terminal/tab records).
    /// - Checkout exists and primary (non-pre-session) terminals exist → the
    ///   daemon died between the primary spawn and the final status flip;
    ///   just flip to `.active`.
    /// - Checkout exists and ONLY a pre-session terminal exists → the daemon
    ///   died mid-wait. The tmux server and the hook process survive daemon
    ///   restarts, so resume the wait: rebuild the `PreSessionSpawn` from the
    ///   terminal record and run phase 3 in a detached task. A row that still
    ///   carries `archivedClaudeSessions` was mid-REVIVE — resume it with
    ///   revive semantics (restore the sessions, then clear them); otherwise
    ///   resume exactly like the create path. Never blocks startup.
    /// - Checkout exists but no terminals at all → the daemon died after
    ///   `git worktree add` but before any tmux spawn. There is no hook
    ///   window to resume and no terminals to keep; delete the row and let
    ///   reconcile re-adopt the on-disk checkout as a fresh worktree.
    /// - Checkout + pre-session terminal exist but the repo row is gone →
    ///   the wait can never be resumed (phase 3 needs the repo) and nothing
    ///   else ever resolves a `.creating` row, so skipping would strand it
    ///   forever. Delete the row and its terminal/tab records.
