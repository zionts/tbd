/// a corpse, and `ProcessIdentityCheck` — the check every other signalling site
/// in this daemon consults. The mapping is deliberately asymmetric, because the
/// two mistakes are not: a refused park is recoverable on the next sweep, and a
/// signal sent to a stranger's process is not.
///
/// - a corpse (`ps` says `Z…`) → `.gone`. Past its last instruction, and its
///   number cannot be reissued while the entry stands.
/// - `.same` → `.ours`. The one verdict that licenses a signal.
/// - `.notRunning` → `.gone`. Nothing holds the pid, so the child this park set
///   out to end is already past its last instruction. This is a *positive*
///   answer about a real pid and may therefore lead to a finalize, exactly like
///   the registry's `.exited`.
/// - `.startTimeMismatch` / `.foreignExecutable` → `.unverifiable`. The pid
///   names a stranger. In the narrow sense our child IS gone — nothing that
///   survives is ours — but "gone" here would mean finalizing a park whose
///   child this daemon never saw exit, over a row it can no longer describe. So
///   the park refuses instead, and only `.notRunning` (and the registry's own
///   `.exited`) are allowed to complete one.
/// - `.startTimeUnreadable` / `.commandUnreadable` → `.unverifiable`. The
///   kernel would not say. "Keep when uncertain" is the doctrine every
///   signalling site here follows, and an unreadable answer is uncertainty, not
///   absence.
/// - no recorded pid → `.unrecorded`. There is nothing to verify and nothing to
///   signal by number, but the holder is still reachable over its socket.

    ///   session that already occupies a slot (`sessionAlreadyRegistered`), so
    ///   without the guard the retry's spawn throws and the row stays parked
    ///   forever — the guard is what turns that throw into a heal.
    /// - **The recorded child pid is identity-verified alive**, through the same
    ///   `ProcessIdentityCheck` the reaper's holder leg consults before it
    ///   signals anything: alive, started within
    ///   `AgentReaper.defaultHolderIdentityWindow` of the row's recorded child
    ///   start, and running an executable a holder's job could be. A pid the

    /// **What the second leg is actually for**, since the obvious answer is
