///      transcript, shuts down MCP children, and fires Stop hooks; poll up to
///      ~3s for the process to actually leave.
///   4. If `/exit` didn't take, fall back to a graceful interrupt
///      (Escape → C-c C-c → SIGTERM) — from Hibernate.
///   5. Either way, `respawn-window` the pane to a bare shell (Hibernate's
///      mechanic: the window/pane and its scrollback survive, freeing the
///      claude process + its RSS). We do NOT kill the window (Suspend's old

/// full uncached input on its next message whether or not the process stayed
