/// The park sequence combines the strengths of both predecessors:
///   1. Capture an ANSI pane snapshot FIRST (from the old Suspend feature) so
///      the app can show the frozen pane as a backdrop while parked / waking.
///   2. Enforce the live rails the DB row can't express (typed-but-unsent
///      input, transcript-tail validity) — from Hibernate.
///   3. Try a polite in-band `/exit` (from Suspend) so Claude flushes its
///      transcript, shuts down MCP children, and fires Stop hooks; poll up to
///      ~3s for the process to actually leave.
///   4. If `/exit` didn't take, fall back to a graceful interrupt
///      (Escape → C-c C-c → SIGTERM) — from Hibernate.
///   5. Either way, `respawn-window` the pane to a bare shell (Hibernate's
///      mechanic: the window/pane and its scrollback survive, freeing the
///      claude process + its RSS). We do NOT kill the window (Suspend's old
///      mechanic).
///   6. Verify the shell survived + log orphaned claude children.

///      persist the snapshot.

/// Wake `respawn-window`s the same pane back to `claude --resume`. It is the ONE
/// resume path for auto-parked, manually-parked, and (via reconcile) died
/// sessions; it clears BOTH `hibernatedAt` and any legacy `suspendedAt`.
///
/// The prompt cache expires after ~5 min idle, so a session past the TTL pays
/// full uncached input on its next message whether or not the process stayed
/// alive — parking an idle session is therefore nearly free.

    /// silently dropped.
    ///
    /// So ask — using the SAME probe `terminal.send` asks with
