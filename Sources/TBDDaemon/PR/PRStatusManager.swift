    ///   `branch.<name>.merge` records the *base* a branch was cut from, so
    ///   offering it as a head ref attached whatever PR someone once opened FROM
    ///   the base branch to every worktree whose own branch had no PR yet.
    /// - The **push branch**, when `@{push}` resolved — subject to the same
    ///   default-branch exclusion. It is what finds a triangular workflow, where
    ///   a push refspec sends the branch somewhere neither name predicts. The
    ///   exclusion is not optional: under `push.default = upstream`, `@{push}`
    ///   IS the upstream, so a base-tracking branch resolves straight to the
    ///   default branch (measured on real git) and an unfiltered push candidate
    ///   would reopen this very bug for anyone using that config.
    ///
    /// A nil `defaultBranch` leaves the local branch alone as the only candidate:
    /// without knowing the base, no other name can be shown not to be one, and a
    /// wrong head-ref candidate is the whole bug.
    ///
    /// KNOWN RESIDUALS, all narrow and all deliberately not addressed here:
    ///
    /// - A **stacked branch** tracking a non-default feature base keeps its
    ///   tracked-branch candidate (that base is not the default branch), so it
    ///   can still be attached to the base's PR. Same class as the bug this
    ///   fixes, narrower, unobserved in the field.
    /// - A **stale or wrong `repo.defaultBranch`** makes the exclusion miss, so
    ///   the fix silently does not apply on that repo. The stored value is
    ///   written once at repo registration and never refreshed. It is usually
    ///   right: `GitManager.detectDefaultBranch` reads
    ///   `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, which `git clone` writes and most checkouts
    ///   therefore carry (36 of 44 local repos, measured). The gap is its
    ///   fallback — with no `origin/HEAD` it reports whichever branch is checked
    ///   out, which is a different fact wearing the same name.
    ///
    ///   Re-probing periodically does not fix that, it spreads it: on exactly
    ///   the repos whose stored value can be wrong, the probe is a current-
    ///   branch reader, so a main checkout parked on a feature branch would
    ///   rewrite the stored value on every daemon start and flip it back on the
    ///   next. The fact is not local to PR matching — it also picks the base for
    ///   every new worktree, the fresh-revive base, the periodic fetch, and the
    ///   conflict sweep (`WorktreeLifecycle+Reconcile`) — so a value that
    ///   thrashes is worse than one that is occasionally stale.
    /// - A **rename-push whose target is named like the default branch** (e.g. a
    ///   fork PR pushed as `fix-thing:main`) is indistinguishable from a base
    ///   attachment: the tracked branch is `main`, the repo default is
    ///   legitimately `main`, and every heal condition holds on a PR that really
    ///   is this branch's own. That loss is durable, not a missed poll — the
    ///   candidate list will never offer `main` again, so neither
