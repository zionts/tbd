// MARK: - The actuation boundary
//
// A row exists for acts that touch a session's **process, pty, or lifecycle**.
//
//  - IN: spawning or disposing of a session, parking or waking one, and
//    sending payload into one — local (tmux) or remote (provider).
//  - OUT: DB-only settings *about* a session (`setKeepWarm`, `setPin`,
//    renames, config writes, worktree/notes/repo mutations). Nothing there
//    reaches a process, so nothing there is an actuation.
//  - Sub-steps of one actuation are NOT separate rows. The polite `/exit`,
//    the Escape/C-c and the SIGTERM inside a hibernate, the interrupt inside
//    a profile swap, the paste-then-Enter inside a send — one row per
//    actuation-level intent, at the moment the intent is acted on.
//    The auto-`/login` pump a login spawn arms (`armLoginSession`) is a
//    sub-step too, even though its `/login` paste lands seconds later: the
//    operator asked for one thing — a session logged into this profile — and
//    the typing is how the spawn finishes, not a second intent. When the
//    observed rung lands it will confirm that spawn's row, not open a new one.
//
// Two layers write, and only two: the **RPC handler** for anything a caller
// asked for, and a **rail's own entry point** for anything the daemon started
// by itself. The shared lifecycle internals in between — `captureThenKillWindow`,
// `killWindowAndReap`, `performHibernate`, `closeScratchTerminals` — stay
// silent, because both `worktree.archive` and the boot-time reconcile sweep
// reach them and a row down there would double-count every archive. Reconcile
// is an entry point in its own right (boot is what invoked it), so its rows are
// rail-level logging rather than shared-path logging.
//
// The two layers name different things, deliberately. A worktree-level RPC
// (`worktree.archive`, `worktree.forget`, `scratch.delete`) writes ONE row
// naming the worktree, with no terminal: the caller asked for one thing and the
// per-terminal kills are how the lifecycle carries it out. Reconcile writes one
// row PER act, because each kill or park it performs is an independent decision
// it made about a terminal it has already resolved. `repo.remove`'s cascade sits
// between the two and follows reconcile: the handler resolves a LIST of
// worktrees and archives each one through a separate lifecycle call, so each is
// its own teardown and gets its own worktree-named row.
//
// The wired set lives here, in one file next to the writer, so a reviewer can
// see it at a glance: `method` names the door a request came through and
// `kind` names the act, and both are spelled once, per surface.
//
// The mechanical guard is the SwiftLint custom rule `actuation_primitive_allowlist`
// in `.swiftlint.yml`: calling a tmux/park primitive from a daemon file outside
// the audited set fails the build, so a new actuation surface has to be wired
// here before it can be written.

/// The public RPC surfaces that actuate a session, and what each one is.
///
/// Two exhaustive switches rather than a dictionary: the compiler then proves
/// every wired surface has both a method name and a kind, and a handler cannot
/// silently drift onto the wrong one.
