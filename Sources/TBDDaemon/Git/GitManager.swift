/// background grandchildren (a login shell's rc files often do), they inherit
/// the pipe write end and EOF never arrives after the direct child dies. A
/// blocking read-to-EOF would park a thread — and retain the pipe FD and every

/// drains only what is already buffered in the kernel pipe (non-blocking) and
/// closes the parent's read end, so nothing outlives the call.
