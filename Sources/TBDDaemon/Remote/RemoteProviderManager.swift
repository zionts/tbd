            // value still wins, so recovery-with-new-detail is unaffected.

            // Why the asymmetry: text on file under `.ok`/`.stale`/`.error`
            // describes a DIFFERENT condition. Inheriting it across a
            // transition INTO `.needsAuth` would render, say, a transport
            // timeout as the provider's authentication explanation — wrong
            // words in the one string this CTA exists to deliver. On such a
            // transition the fields go `nil` and the app renders its neutral
            // fallback CTA instead. This still covers the path the
            // inheritance was added for: `recordAttachExit` sets `.needsAuth`
            // BEFORE firing its probe, so the probe's `recordFailure` sees a
            // previous state of `.needsAuth`.
