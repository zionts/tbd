/// the whole process group, and a `readabilityHandler`-driven line reader. Read
/// that file for the full rationale behind each of those; the comments here
/// cover only what differs.
///
/// Four things differ, all load-bearing:
///
/// - **Duplex.** `events` is stdout-only. This also writes frames to the
///   child's stdin, on a non-blocking fd: a frame is handed over in as many
///   `write(2)`s as the pipe has room for, waiting on the injected clock
///   between them, and a frame that cannot finish inside a bounded budget
///   fails rather than parking the caller. A wedged child whose stdin pipe has
///   filled would otherwise starve whichever actor called `send`. See `write`
///   for why the refill loop is mandatory rather than an optimisation.
/// - **A tighter silence limit**, `PeerBridgeFrameCodec.silenceLimit` (30 s
///   against `events`' 90 s), with a matching `ping` cadence of
///   `PeerBridgeFrameCodec.keepaliveInterval`. Detection latency here bounds how
///   long a shadow peer can lie about being reachable.
/// - **Link state is an output**, published to the handler on change.
/// - **Resync is by `hello`, not by cursor.** Every connection opens with our
///   `hello` and completes when the provider answers with its own. Nothing is
///   carried across a reconnect: the far side unlinks everything when the stream
///   ends, and the roster is re-announced from scratch.

    ///   budget with `sent > 0`, and lands on `truncated` — which tears the
    ///   link down and unpublishes every shadow peer for the provider. So this

    ///   floor**, and a reader below it loses its link rather than merely
    ///   running slowly.
