/// The repositories one provider hosts sessions in, remembered across a failed

///
/// The scope is recomputed from the worktree table on every reconcile tick, and
/// **scope retirement unannounces**: a repository leaving the scope withdraws
/// its roster registration and writes `peer-gone` for every local session
/// announced on it. A resolver that answered a transient database error with
/// the empty set would therefore tear down every announced peer for the
/// provider on one bad tick and rebuild them on the next. So "unknown" must not
/// be spelled the same way as "hosts no repositories" — which is exactly what
/// the `(try? ...) ?? []` this replaced did.
///
/// `resolve()` keeps the scope the last successful read produced and hands that
/// back when a read fails, leaving the scope where it was. Before any read has
/// ever succeeded it returns `nil` rather than `[]`: there is nothing to
/// reconcile toward yet, which is a different statement from "the scope is
/// empty" and the one the caller must not conflate.
///
/// Acting on stale state is a thing to be able to see, so it is counted and
/// logged rather than absorbed: every failed read logs at `.error` with the run
/// length and the size of the scope being replayed, and the read that recovers
/// logs the far end of that window, so a stale span appears in the log as a
/// span rather than as a silence. `failedReads` and `consecutiveFailures` are
/// readable for the same reason — a future `peer.status` row is the natural
/// place to surface them beside `linkState`.
///
/// **Nothing bounds how long a scope may stay stale, and that is the accepted
/// trade rather than an oversight.** The counters above are the whole response
/// to a failing read: no expiry, no ceiling, no degraded mode. A read that
/// fails permanently — a schema break rather than a hiccup — therefore freezes
/// the scope at its last good value for as long as the daemon runs, and this
/// scope is a trust boundary, deciding which local sessions a remote host can
/// reach. It is accepted because of what the frozen value can and cannot be: a
/// scope only ever comes from a read that succeeded, so retaining one keeps
/// announcing into repositories the provider genuinely hosted sessions in at
/// that moment. Staleness can go on admitting a repository that should have
/// left the scope, and can miss one that should have joined it; it can never
/// admit one that was never in it, so no amount of it becomes a cross-project
/// leak. An expiry that bounded it would buy nothing against that and would
/// cost the failure this type exists to prevent — on the one signal it cannot
/// tell apart from a hiccup, it would retire every announced peer for the
/// provider.
