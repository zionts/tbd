/// - **A free lock is not proof the predecessor is gone.** `POST /tbd/retire`
///   answers as soon as the listener is closed and the lock released, and the
///   old process keeps draining for up to ten minutes. The successor is
///   spawned the moment the answer arrives and nothing here ever waits for an
///   exit.
/// - **Different, not older.** A proxy is replaced when its version differs
///   from the binary this daemon would spawn, in either direction, because
///   `tbd update` keeps the previous app bundle as a rollback route and a
///   rollback must replace the newer image it rolled back from.
