/// Starts one `TBDModelProxy` for a TBD home and waits for it to say which
/// port it took.
///
/// The ordering is the contract, and it is the holder spawner's with the
/// socket swapped for a port (spec, "Rendezvous and identity"):
///
///   1. `<home>/proxy` must exist before anything is created in it. A home
///      that cannot be made usable fails here, before any process exists.
///   2. `proxy.lock` is taken **before the spawn**, so two daemons on one TBD
///      home cannot both mint a proxy, and a spawner that cannot take it has
///      learned a live proxy owns this home without connecting to it.
///   3. The lock travels to the child as a **descriptor number**, placed by a
///      `posix_spawn` `dup2` file action — the same mechanism, and for the
///      same reason, as `HolderSpawner`: `FD_CLOEXEC` is cleared on a
///      duplicate rather than on the daemon's own descriptor, so no unrelated
///      concurrent spawn in this process can inherit the lock.
///   4. The child's stdio is detached, with stdout and stderr in
///      `proxy.log` — the proxy's only channel for anything that goes wrong
///      before its logger is up.
///   5. The daemon drops its own copy of the lock right after `posix_spawn`,
///      so the child alone holds it and the kernel releases it when the child
///      dies.
///   6. The pid file is polled on the **injected clock** until it names *this
///      child* and a port. The pid match is what keeps a predecessor's file
///      from being read as this spawn's answer.
///
/// **Who reclaims a proxy is not answered here.** The proxy is spawned as a
/// direct child of the daemon and deliberately outlives it, exactly as a
/// holder does. `ModelProxySupervisor` owns the live one — it adopts, watches,
/// respawns and retires — and the `OrphanGC` leg sweeps the rendezvous files a
/// SIGKILLed proxy could not unlink. What this type guarantees on its own is
/// narrower and worth stating: **every proxy it starts and cannot finish
/// starting is killed and reaped before the throw**, so a failed spawn leaves
/// no process, and no lock, behind.
