/// The base environment any process the daemon spawns starts from: a holder
/// job, or a tmux server.
///
/// A daemon's environment describes the program that launched the daemon as
/// much as it describes the machine. `scripts/restart.sh` is usually run from
/// inside a Claude Code session, so the daemon inherits that session's exported
/// identity — and every process the daemon forks would inherit it in turn.
///
/// That inheritance is not cosmetic. An interactive Claude Code that finds
/// `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` in its environment concludes it is a nested
/// child of another session: it writes no row into the cross-session peer
/// registry (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/sessions/<pid>.json`), and it disables session
/// persistence, so the session gets no transcript either. The session runs
/// fine and is invisible to everything that reads those two surfaces.
///
/// TBD's own per-terminal exports do the same damage to TBD's own surfaces, and
/// the incarnation id is the load-bearing one. `AgentProcessEnvironment.replacement`
/// exports `TBD_TERMINAL_INCARNATION_ID` on every woken or restarted agent, so a
/// daemon restarted from such a session carries it; nothing on a fresh spawn
/// overwrites it, because the export prefix sets only `TBD_TERMINAL_ID` and
/// `TBD_WORKTREE_ID`. A fresh terminal row has no incarnation, so the guard in
/// `TerminalStore.applySessionStart` (`record.sessionIncarnationID ==
/// reportedIncarnationID?.uuidString`) fails and the job's SessionStart,
/// SessionEnd and activity hooks are all dropped: no session id, no transcript
/// path, activity never updates. An inherited `TBD_CLI_PATH` is the same shape
/// one layer down — it points the job's hooks (`"${TBD_CLI_PATH-tbd}"`) at
/// whichever worktree's CLI the launcher happened to be given.
///
/// Claude Code has a second question it can ask on the tmux transport: when
/// `$TMUX` is set it probes the tmux server's global environment for the same
/// marker, and a marker found there is ambient — the server's, not this
/// session's — so it is ignored. That probe is why the tmux path never showed
/// the Claude-side symptom, and the holder transport, having no tmux server for
/// the probe to ask, showed it immediately. TBD's own incarnation guard has no
/// such probe, so the tmux server needs the scrub too, for TBD's markers.
/// Stripping Claude's from the server as well costs nothing *on a server the
/// daemon creates*: no pane predates that spawn, so it leaves panes with no
/// marker at all, which is what the probe was there to simulate. It is not free
/// on a server repaired in place, where panes already hold their own copy — see
/// `serverRepairableMarkers`. Removing the markers at the source is what makes
/// the two transports behave alike.
///
/// **What belongs in the set.** One criterion across all four groups: the
/// identity of the process that launched the daemon — its session, its
/// terminal, its pane, its trace. Never machine, user, or installation
/// configuration. The set is the whole list, not half of one:
/// `Daemon.scrubInheritedTBDEnv` applies it to the daemon's own environment at
/// startup, so every child the daemon spawns through plain inheritance loses
/// the same names these two spawn seams strip explicitly. Claude Code
/// configuration a user may deliberately set in their login environment
/// (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` and anything like it) is not identity, and
/// neither is TBD's own installation configuration.
/// `TBD_HOME` and `TBD_SOCKET_PATH` name *which installation* everything
/// belongs to — the holder rendezvous directory derives from `TBD_HOME`, and so
/// does the socket a `tbd` invocation inside the job reaches for — so a job that
/// lost them would answer to a different installation than the daemon that
/// spawned it. All of it must keep flowing to the job exactly as the tmux path
/// delivers it.
///
/// `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is the one name whose *value* decides, because both
/// kinds of value share it. TBD injects one per spawn for a profile-bound
/// Claude session, naming a directory under this installation's profiles root
/// (`ClaudeSpawnCommandBuilder`, `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager`); a
/// profile-less spawn injects nothing, so a daemon restarted from a
/// profile-bound session would otherwise hand its launcher's profile — that
/// profile's credential and settings — to every profile-less job. Only TBD
/// itself writes a value under that directory, so such a value is per-spawn
/// identity by construction and is dropped. Any other value is the user's own
/// configuration, which TBD honours (`ClaudeTrustSeeder` resolves it), and is
/// kept.
///
/// **TERM is pinned rather than inherited**, for a related but distinct reason:
/// it describes the terminal a job draws into, not the program that launched
/// the daemon. The tmux path does not inherit it either, because
/// `TmuxManager.ensureServer` sets `default-terminal xterm-256color` on every
/// server and so every pane gets that value. The holder transport pins the same
/// one: otherwise a daemon restarted from another terminal emulator hands the
/// job that emulator's TERM — a terminfo the holder's reader may not implement —
/// and a daemon the app launched itself has no TERM at all. Two sibling helpers
/// pin the same value: `TerminalPanelView.makeViewerEnvironment` strips
/// `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` and pins TERM for the grouped-session viewer, and
/// `BoundedProcessClaudeSpawner.invocationEnvironment` pins it when it runs a
/// child under a pseudo-terminal.
///
/// **The scrub applies to the inherited base only.** Values the spawn itself
/// decided — `sensitiveEnv`: profile env overrides, auth and routing — are
/// merged on top afterwards and win, so a deliberate override of one of these
/// names, TERM and a profile-bound `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` included, reaches the job
/// unharmed.
