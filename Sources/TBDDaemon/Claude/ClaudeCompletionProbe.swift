/// Asks a Claude Code binary what commands, skills and subagents it knows.
///
/// Claude Code has no flag that prints its commands, and only the running program
/// knows its built-ins. Its headless mode does answer one control-protocol
/// request, `initialize`, with every command's name, description, argument hint
/// and aliases, plus every subagent, in one flat list covering built-ins, user
/// and project commands, skills, and plugin items namespaced `plugin:name`.
///
/// So the probe starts the binary in print mode with stream-json in and out,
/// writes one `initialize` request, reads the one response line, closes stdin and
/// waits. Measured on 2.1.261 against a real logged-in profile: about half a
/// second wall time, 209 commands, zero tokens, and no credentials required.
/// Project trust does not gate it — a project with no trust record, one with
/// trust recorded, and an empty config directory all returned the project's
/// commands, skills and agents identically.
///
/// **Every flag on the command line closes a measured side effect.** Removing one
/// reintroduces its effect silently, which is why `arguments(mcpConfigPath:)` is
/// pure and asserted rather than assembled inline:
///
/// - Without `disableAllHooks`, every `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` hook in the
///   profile, the project and enabled plugins runs on every probe, and each probe
///   leaves an empty `session-env/<uuid>/` directory behind. Merging hook arrays
///   through the overlay does not suppress them, no environment variable does,
///   and bare mode does but drops every user skill and plugin command.
/// - Without `disableClaudeAiConnectors`, a probe in OAuth mode sends an
///   authenticated request to the Anthropic API host to list cloud connectors,
///   and the nonessential-traffic switch does not stop it.
/// - Without the strict empty MCP configuration, the profile's real MCP servers
///   start: measured leaking orphaned processes and writing logs into the
///   person's Library folder.
///
/// The environment is the session's own spawn environment, unmodified. The probe
/// adds no credentials of its own: adding an API key to an OAuth profile's
/// environment changes the auth path and loses three subscription-gated commands.
/// A profile whose own environment carries a key or an endpoint keeps it, because
/// that is the environment the session runs in.
///
/// **Not read-only against `.claude.json`.** In a fresh config directory it writes
/// first-run metadata and a backup file; against an existing project entry it
/// rewrote the entry, keeping the trust key and dropping an onboarding key. Every
/// caller must therefore run it through `ClaudeConfigDirSerializer`, which is
/// where it is ordered against `ClaudeTrustSeeder`.
///
/// **Reconciler note.** One process and one temporary file, each reclaimed by
/// the call itself: the process by `runBoundedProcess`, whose deadline signals
/// the child by pid and escalates SIGTERM to SIGKILL on its own watchdog
/// thread, and the file by the `defer` in `run`. Reclaiming the child by pid is
/// enough because the child can have no descendants of its own, and that is a
/// consequence of the flags rather than an assumption: `disableAllHooks` and
/// the strict empty MCP configuration remove the only two things a probe would
/// otherwise spawn. Nothing durable is created either — no git ref, no
/// worktree, no tmux server, no file that outlives the call — so there is no
/// orphan for a sweep to reclaim and none covers this.
