/// Pre-accepts Claude Code's "Do you trust the files in this folder?" dialog for
/// directories whose trust answer TBD already holds.
///
/// **Why pre-seeding is legitimate, not a bypass.** The dialog asks one
/// question: "is this a project you created, or one you trust?" For a worktree
/// TBD created — from a repo the operator explicitly registered with TBD — the
/// answer is yes *by construction*. TBD holds every fact the dialog is asking
/// about: it knows the directory is brand new, that it made it, and which
/// registered repo it came from. Seeding does not skip the question; it writes
/// the already-known answer through Claude's own config persistence, so the
/// prompt never renders.
///
/// The same argument covers a repo's **`.main` worktree**, which TBD did not
/// create: pointing `tbd repo add` at a checkout is itself a deliberate
/// operator trust gesture, so that directory is "one you trust" even though it
/// is not "one TBD made".
///
/// It does **not** cover contents TBD merely *hosted*. A worktree flagged
/// `foreignHead` was checked out from a pull-request head TBD fetched
/// (`refs/pull/<n>/head`) rather than from a branch already present in the
/// operator's repo. TBD created the directory, but the `.claude/settings.json`,
/// hooks, MCP config and `CLAUDE.md` inside it came in with that fetched ref —
/// which may be a third-party fork's. That is precisely what the dialog exists
/// to gate, so these worktrees are never seeded and Claude asks as usual.
///
/// **Why prevention is the only fix.** The trust dialog blocks *before*
/// SessionStart, so no Claude Code hook ever fires while it is up. A session
/// stalled on trust is machine-invisible to TBD — nothing can detect it, and
/// nothing can dismiss it. Fleet worktrees would simply sit there at first
/// spawn. There is no detect-and-recover path; there is only never rendering
/// the dialog.
///
/// Claude Code persists the decision per-directory in
/// `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/.claude.json` under
/// `projects["<absolute-cwd-path>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted = true`. A fresh
/// worktree or scratch dir has never been seen at that path, so the key is
/// absent and Claude prompts.
///
/// **Two-tier gate** (`ensureTrusted`):
/// - **Scratch spaces seed unconditionally.** TBD created the directory, owns
///   it, and it is empty — there is nothing there a trust prompt could protect,
///   and the dir is new on every spawn so the prompt would otherwise be
///   guaranteed. Not user-configurable, and not subject to the `foreignHead`
///   exclusion: a scratch space has no git contents at all.
/// - **Non-scratch worktrees seed only when `autoTrustWorktrees` is on**
///   (`config.auto_trust_worktrees`, default ON) **and the worktree is not
///   `foreignHead`.** These live in real repos with real contents, so an
///   operator who wants Claude to ask anyway can turn the setting off. Turning
///   it off never un-trusts an already seeded path; it only stops future
///   seeding, including for worktrees that were never seeded before.
///
/// This is a separate gate from `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which does NOT
/// suppress the trust dialog. There is no CLI flag or env var for it; pre-seeding
/// the JSON key is the only mechanism.
///
/// **Concurrency.** `.claude.json` is a single shared file that many worktrees
/// target at once (the six seed call sites fire on create, extra-session
/// restore, terminal create, revive, profile swap and hibernation wake, across
/// unrelated repos and therefore unrelated `RepoSerializer` lanes). The
/// read-merge-write is not atomic on its own, so it runs inside
/// `ClaudeTrustSeeder.writer`, an actor whose critical section covers read →
/// parse → merge → atomic rename. That makes TBD's own seeds safe against each
/// other: two worktrees can never both read the same base and have the loser's
/// key dropped by the winner's rename. See `writer` for what it does *not*
/// cover.
///
/// Known limitation (degrades gracefully to the status quo): when a user sets
/// `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` only in their interactive shell rc (e.g. `.zshrc`) and uses
/// no TBD model profile, the daemon can't observe that value — it isn't in the
/// daemon's own environment. The seed then lands in `~/.claude.json` while the
/// spawned pane reads config from the shell-rc dir, so the trust prompt still
/// appears. This is no worse than the pre-seeder behavior and is unresolvable from
/// the daemon side, so we accept it. A `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` the daemon inherited
/// from the session that launched it, naming a directory under this
/// installation's profiles root, is likewise not observed — deliberately, since
/// `SpawnBaseEnvironment` strips exactly that value from the base the spawned
/// pane receives, so seeding into it would seed a config dir no job reads.
