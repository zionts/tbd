/// Answers "what can this session complete?" — the daemon side of
/// `terminal.completions`.
///
/// Three decisions sit between the RPC and the answer.
///
/// **Which binary to ask.** Claude Code updates itself in the background and a
/// running session keeps the old binary until it restarts; five versions sit side
/// by side on this machine and two ran at once with different command counts. So
/// the probe asks the executable the session *is running*, read from the process
/// table by the recorded child pid through the shared process-path helper, and
/// falls back silently to the daemon's normally resolved executable when the pid
/// is unknown, the child has not yet exec'd, or the versioned file is gone. The
/// fallback carries no marker: offering a command the running session lacks costs
/// one "unknown command" reply, which is tolerable, and a marker would add a
/// field to the RPC and a state to the UI for nothing.
///
/// **Whether to ask at all.** Results are cached per executable identity, profile
/// config directory and worktree path. The cache is stale when the modification
/// time changes on the settings file, on the commands, skills or agents
/// directories under the config directory or the worktree's `.claude`, or on the
/// two plugin manifests — a handful of `stat` calls. The probe runs only on a
/// cache miss, never on a timer and never on a keystroke.
///
/// **What to answer when the binary does not.** A failed or timed-out probe falls
/// back to the filesystem scan, marked `.fallback` / `.scan`. The app renders both
/// identically. A fallback is deliberately not cached: the next request tries the
/// binary again rather than serving a degraded list until something on disk
/// happens to change.
///
/// Two probe outcomes reach this type as `ProbeError.timedOut` and are worth
/// naming, because neither is a binary that refused to answer. A cancelled probe
/// surfaces that way — the bounded-process runner relays cancellation as a
/// timeout — and so does a child that emitted the answer but lingered past the
/// deadline, whose answer is dropped with it. Both land on the scan fallback,
/// which is the designed degradation rather than a case to special-case here.
///
/// Every probe runs inside `ClaudeConfigDirSerializer`, because the probe rewrites
/// `.claude.json` and `ClaudeTrustSeeder` does too.
