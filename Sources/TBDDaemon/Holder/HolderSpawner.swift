///   2. The creation lock is taken **before** the socket path is examined. A
///      spawner that cannot take it has learned a live holder owns this UUID
///      without connecting, and must back off rather than clear the path.
///   3. A socket with no sibling lock file is *unowned-but-unproven*, never
///      unowned: it is probed, and only a connect that fails outright licenses
///      unlinking it.
///   4. The lock travels to the holder as a **descriptor number**, placed by a
///      `posix_spawn` `dup2` file action — and so does the launch request,
///      which carries the session's environment and therefore may not go on a
///      command line that `ps` shows to every process on the machine.
///   5. The holder's stdio is detached, with stderr somewhere retrievable.
///   6. The daemon drops its own copy of the lock, so the holder alone holds it
///      and the kernel drops it when the holder dies.
///   7. The socket is polled for reachability on the injected clock, then
///      handshaken — and the connection that answered is **returned, not
///      closed**, because a caller made to reconnect would race the holder's
///      notice that the handshake connection went away. See
///      `HolderSpawnResult`.
///   8. A holder that never answers is judged by whether its socket exists,
///      never by the handshake alone: no socket means it never bound and so
///      never forked, which is the only state where killing it can orphan
///      nothing. See `resolveUnreachableHolder`.
///
/// **Who reclaims a holder is not answered here.** The holder is spawned as a
/// direct child of the daemon, so a daemon that outlives it must reap its exit
/// status, and a holder orphaned by a daemon crash is reclaimed by nothing
/// today. Both belong to the reconcilers Milestone B adds, and all three now
/// exist — the `OrphanGC` rendezvous sweep (`HolderRendezvousCollector`, under
/// `gcEnabled`) unlinks the files a dead holder left behind,
/// `AgentReaper.sweepHolderChildren` kills the **job** a dead holder left
/// running, and the
/// `WorktreeLifecycle+Reconcile` holder inventory
/// (`holderRowVerdict(for:)`) parks or deletes the *row* whose holder is gone.
/// What none of them reclaims is a row-less holder's job after the holder has
/// died. `RowlessHolderCollector` recovers the child pid from the holder's own
/// handshake, so it reaches only a holder still alive enough to answer one;
/// `HolderRendezvousCollector` unlinks that dead holder's files and signals
/// nothing; and both `AgentReaper.sweepHolderChildren` and the reconcile arm
/// read session rows, which is the half by definition missing. The job
