/// pty's session leader, and XNU's `proc_exit` calls `ttywait` on the
/// controlling terminal before revoking it: a job that exits with anything at
/// all still queued on the terminal stops half-exited in `P_WEXIT`, and the
/// holder's `waitpid` correctly reports nothing, because nothing has happened
/// yet. A few bytes of ordinary echo are enough. So whoever holds the master
/// **must read it unconditionally** — not lazily, not only while somebody wants
/// a screen, not only while a session is idle. A reader that stops reading is
/// not falling behind; it is holding jobs open.

/// emulator is where the bytes go, but emptying the queue is why the loop runs.
