/// The daemon's single owner of every live `HolderReader`.
///
/// **A reader lives only in the memory of the daemon that made one**, and the
/// session it drains does not. That asymmetry is the whole reason this type
/// exists: a restarted daemon inherits holders and jobs that are still running
/// and has no reader for any of them, so nothing drains their pty masters —
/// which is not merely "no screen to show". A job cannot finish exiting while
/// anything it wrote is still queued on its terminal (XNU's `proc_exit` calls
/// `ttywait` before revoking it), so an undrained session silently piles up
/// half-exited jobs. Re-adoption is therefore a liveness obligation of startup,
/// not a convenience for rendering.
///
/// Two invariants shape the API:
///
///   - **One reader per session, ever.** Two drain loops on one pty master is
///     silent byte theft — each `read` takes bytes the other will never see,
///     and nothing anywhere reports it. Adoption is therefore idempotent
///     through the actor's own state: a second call for a session already being
///     adopted *awaits the first* rather than racing it.
///   - **Whoever owns a reader stops it.** After end of file a drain thread
///     parks on its wake pipe instead of exiting, deliberately — that is what
///     keeps the descriptor's close on the stop path, where no `write` can race
///     a reused fd number. So a reader that is dropped without `stop()` leaks a
///     thread and a descriptor, and this registry is the owner that must not do
///     that. See `release(terminalID:)`.
