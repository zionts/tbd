/// Delivers one daemon-originated write to a holder-backed session, routed by
/// **who is reading that session's pty**.
///
/// Two writers exist for any session: the person at the keyboard, and the
/// daemon (`tbd terminal send`, queued prompts, the Claude limit-resume
/// actuator). On the tmux transport they never collide, because every byte
/// funnels through one tmux server process that serializes them for free. On
/// the holder transport the app and the daemon hold separate descriptors for
/// the same pty master, and a `write()` to a tty is not atomic — so a daemon
/// injection landing mid-keystroke can shear, and one landing between a
/// bracketed paste's `ESC[200~`/`ESC[201~` markers is silently absorbed into
/// the pasted text.
///
/// The rule that closes it, from
/// `docs/specs/2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md` ("Input is
/// not arbitrated, but it is serialized"):
///
/// - **Detached** — nobody else is on the pty, so the daemon writes to its own
///   dup.
/// - **Attached** — the daemon sends an `.injection` frame and waits for the
///   app's `.injectionAck`. The app is then the session's only writer as well
///   as its only reader, and the concurrency does not exist.
/// - **No usable answer before the deadline** — the daemon writes anyway.
///
/// ## The last rule fails *open*, and it can deliver twice
///
/// A missing ack does not mean the injection was not delivered: the app may
/// have written it and had the ack lost or merely delayed, which App Nap can
/// cause by coalescing a backgrounded app's work far past any deadline worth
/// waiting on. So the fallback can deliver an injection **twice**. That is the
/// at-least-once versus at-most-once fork, taken knowingly in favour of
/// at-least-once: a duplicated prompt is visible and recoverable, a silently
/// dropped one strands an agent indefinitely with nothing to see.
///
/// **Do not "fix" the duplicate by acking before writing.** That trades a
/// visible duplicate for exactly the invisible loss this design rejected, and
/// it will look like a tidy-up. For the same reason a late ack — one arriving
/// after its injection has already been written directly — is *recorded and
/// dropped*, never used to retract or dedupe the write that already happened.
///
/// ## What the deadline may be, and what it must be longer than
///
/// The number is not the point; its *relationship* to the app-side hold is.
/// `OutgoingInputQueue` (TBDApp) parks an injection that arrives while a user
/// paste is open, and that hold must stay strictly shorter than this deadline
/// — otherwise every held injection would be written directly by the daemon
/// while the paste is still open, landing between the markers, which is the
/// precise harm the app-side queue exists to prevent, made systematic rather
/// than rare.
///
/// Neither side can see the other's literal, so both live together in
/// `HolderInputTiming` (TBDShared): `injectionAckDeadline` is the default for
/// `ackDeadline` below, `pasteHoldBound` is the default for the app's hold, and
/// that one type carries the full statement of the invariant along with the
/// tests that enforce it. `ackDeadline` stays a defaulted parameter so a test
/// can still inject a deadline of its own.
