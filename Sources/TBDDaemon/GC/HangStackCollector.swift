    ///    consideration before either policy test — the app may hold the newest
    ///    file open, appending resamples, and silently discarding the stack of a
    ///    hang in progress is a bad trade for nothing.

    ///    (creation date when that is missing), with the filename as a
    ///    tiebreaker so equal timestamps rank deterministically.
    /// 4. **Policy.** A file is selected when it is older than
    ///    `HangStackRetention.maxAge` **or** sits at index
    ///    `>= HangStackRetention.maxFiles` in that order. Age matches how the
