/// Turns one `terminal.send` into the exact bytes the holder transport writes.
///
/// Split out of `performHolderSend` because it is the whole of the decision and
/// none of the plumbing: given a body, whether the send submits, and what the
/// child's bracketed-paste mode is, there is exactly one right answer in bytes.
/// A pure function is testable on whole `Data` values, and whole `Data` values
/// are the only assertion worth making here — a substring check would pass on a
/// message with the submitting `\r` *inside* the paste, which is the defect
/// this composition exists to fix.
///
/// **Why the wrapping matters.** An agent TUI's paste-burst heuristic keys on
/// the *shape* of a chunk, not its byte count, so a `\r` arriving in the same
/// read as a multi-line body gets absorbed into the pasted text and nothing
/// submits — measured at ~230 bytes and again at 4 KB, which is what shows it
/// is not a size effect. Wrapping the body in `ESC[200~`…`ESC[201~` and putting
/// the `\r` after the end marker makes the Enter provably outside the paste.
/// That is the property the tmux arm had, by pasting and pressing Enter as two
/// separate acts; this gets it without splitting the message, so a payload is
/// still never split across a routing decision.
///
/// **An empty body is never wrapped.** `--text "" --submit` is a real way to
/// press Enter, and a bracketed paste of nothing is a pair of markers the child
/// has to interpret for no reason — a shell at its prompt would show them.
///
/// **A send carries no paste marker of its own, in either mode.** Both markers
/// are taken out of every body, wrapped or bare. Inside a wrapping they break
/// it, for reasons that differ. `ESC[201~` inside the paste closes it
/// early, so everything after it — the rest of the body and the submitting
/// `\r` — arrives as keystrokes instead of text, which is precisely the failure
/// the wrapping exists to prevent, reached by content rather than by chunk
/// shape. `ESC[200~` inside the paste restarts it in a child whose reader takes
/// a nested start marker as the beginning of a new paste, discarding everything
/// before it — the dispatch envelope included — so what the child acts on is
/// not what the caller sent. `--text "$(cat some-file)"` is all either takes: a
/// log or a transcript that recorded raw terminal input holds both. A paste
/// marker inside a paste can only ever be a break-out or a restart: there is
/// nothing a child could display for one, so removing it loses nothing a caller
/// meant to send, and removal is done bytewise on the composed body so a marker
/// cannot re-form across a removal.
///
/// **The bare path strips too, and that is not symmetry for its own sake.** A
/// paste marker in a text send is never content a child can display, whichever
/// mode the composition read: with bracketing off the child prints the six
/// bytes or misreads them, so delivering them verbatim serves no caller. And
/// the mode this composition reads can be *stale* — `staleDaemon` is a reading
/// from an emulator that stopped consuming bytes when a viewer took the pty,
/// possibly hours ago — so "bracketing is off" is a guess about a child that
/// may well have turned it on since. An unstripped `ESC[200~` delivered bare to
/// such a child opens a paste nothing closes, and the submitting `\r` and every
/// keystroke after it are swallowed as pasted text. Stripping unconditionally
/// costs a caller nothing it could have meant and removes that failure from
/// both branches.
