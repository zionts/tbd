    /// config directory, spawn environment, working directory and pid, and the
    /// app does not link the daemon library.
    ///
    /// Gated on `transcript_composer_enabled`, and the refusal is an ERROR rather
    /// than an empty inventory. An empty list is a real answer — a session with
    /// no commands — and a caller must not read "the feature is off" as "this
    /// session knows nothing".
    ///
    /// **The probe's environment is the session's, assembled the way the spawn
    /// path assembles it** — `ClaudeSpawnCommandBuilder.build` plus the
    /// free-form overrides its callers layer underneath it. The daemon's own
    /// environment is the base (the tmux server the session runs under inherited
    /// it from this process), then the free-form overrides in the builder's own
    /// precedence — global < repo < profile, `EnvOverrideResolver.merge` — and
    /// then the profile's routing env on top, because the builder layers its
    /// routing over the free-form one so a stray override cannot redirect a
    /// session. The routing half comes from `ClaudeSpawnCommandBuilder.routingEnv`
    /// rather than being restated here, so a bedrock or custom-base-URL profile
    /// is probed through the endpoint and account store its session uses.
    ///
    /// **A probe needs no credentials and adds none of its own.** `routingEnv`
    /// returns non-secret keys only; the builder's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and
    /// `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` are deliberately not reproduced. They change
    /// the auth path without changing the command list, and injecting a key into
    /// an OAuth profile's environment was measured to *lose* three
    /// subscription-gated commands. A profile whose own `envOverrides` carry a
    /// key keeps it, because that is the environment its session runs in.
