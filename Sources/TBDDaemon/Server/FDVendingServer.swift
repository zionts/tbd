///
/// M2.1 promotes the sidecar to a **bidirectional framed data channel**:
/// - daemon → app: `send(fd:header:)` vends a pane read fd wrapped in a
///   length-prefixed `.fdVend` frame (unchanged semantics, now framed).
/// - app → daemon: keystroke `.input` and bulk `.paste` frames, decoded on a
///   dedicated receive `Thread` and delivered via `onInput`/`onPaste`.
///
/// **fd ownership: readers signal, the actor closes.** Each adopted connection
/// gets a receive thread, but the thread NEVER closes the connection fd. On loop
/// exit (EOF, read error, or scanner desync) it hops back onto the actor via
/// `receiveLoopExited(fd:)`, which clears `clientFD` (if it still names this fd)
/// and performs the sole `Darwin.close(fd)`. `adoptConnection`/`disconnect`/`stop`
/// only `shutdown(fd, SHUT_RDWR)` to wake the reader — on Darwin, `close()`ing a
/// socket out from under a thread blocked in `read()` does NOT wake it, but
/// `shutdown()` does; the reader then unblocks and signals its own exit.
///
/// Making the actor the sole closer closes a stale-fd hole: if the reader closed
/// the fd on EOF while `clientFD` still held that number, the kernel could recycle
/// the number for an unrelated pipe/accept/open, and a later `send(fd:header:)`
/// would `sendmsg()` a vend frame into that UNRELATED fd (cross-fd corruption).
/// By clearing `clientFD` before/with the close, `send()` sees `clientFD < 0` and
/// refuses with `.notConnected` instead of writing into a recycled fd.
