    ///
    /// The health check covers `.needsAuth` and NOTHING else, and the
    /// asymmetry is deliberate:
    ///
    /// - `.needsAuth` means the provider itself cannot authenticate, so a
    ///   fresh `attach` dies on connect — the contract's auth-needed section
    ///   says a caller SHOULD NOT spawn new `attach` processes in that state.
    ///   `pendingReconnectBlockedSelections` can't cover this on its own
    ///   because it only ever inspects selections that ALREADY have a
    ///   pending entry, i.e. ones that have already burned a doomed attach;
    ///   a never-attached session under an already-unhealthy provider would
    ///   sail straight past it.
    /// - `.stale` and `.error` deliberately do NOT block. Both describe a
    ///   failing `list` — an unreachable or misbehaving CONTROL path — which
    ///   says nothing about whether `attach` can connect, and `.stale` in
    ///   particular is ordinary transport flake. Blocking on them would turn
    ///   one bad poll into "you can't open your sessions".

    /// Reuses `RemoteSessionDetailGates.available` — the
    /// exact same gate that decides whether the Attach TAB even renders — so
    /// a provider without the capability, or a gone session, can never end up
    /// attach-eligible here while simultaneously having no Attach tab to
    /// show it in (the two must never disagree). The `dismissed` exclusion is
    /// separate: it mirrors `usableEntryIndex`'s navigation-staleness
    /// predicate (`AppState+Navigation.swift`), which excludes `dismissed`
    /// but keeps `gone`. Currently unreachable in practice — Dismiss is only
    /// offered on `gone` rows, and `gone` alone already blocks eligibility
    /// above — but kept explicit so the two predicates can't silently drift
