///
/// Three in-place pages (NOT nested popovers — those are fragile on macOS):
///  - `.profiles` (default): a fixed "Choose a branch…" drill-in row at the
///    top, then up to two "start something other than a plain local worktree"
///    rows beneath it — an optional "New cloud session" row for the compiled
///    cloud provider (see `cloudLaneEntry`) and an optional "New remote
///    session" row for the providers the user configured themselves (see
///    `remoteLaneOffer`) — then one row per configured model profile.
///    Each of those two rows carries a trailing ellipsis only when selecting
///    it will itself open the create form — never when it drills into the
///    provider list, where the chevron says so.
///    Selecting a profile row one-click-creates a worktree
///    pinned to that profile. (A plain click on the `+` — without opening this
///    menu — already creates a default worktree via repo → scratch → global
///    default precedence, so there is no separate "resolve automatically" row
///    here.)
///  - `.branches`: the reused searchable branch list (`BranchListView`) behind
///    a back affordance. Selecting a branch creates a worktree on that existing
///    branch using the DEFAULT model (accepted tradeoff).
///  - `.remoteProviders`: one row per provider the user configured, reached
///    only when more than one of those is registered — the compiled cloud
///    provider is never a member and never lands here, because it has its own
///    row on the page above. A third page rather than a nested
///    `Menu`/popover for the same reason `.branches` is one. Each row carries
///    its own trailing ellipsis when selecting that provider will open the
///    create form, since these are the rows that act.

/// per-page (see `body`) so the short profiles list isn't padded out to the
