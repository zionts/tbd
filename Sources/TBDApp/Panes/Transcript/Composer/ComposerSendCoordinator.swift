/// How a composed message leaves the app.
///
/// Two paths, and the branch between them is a machine fact rather than a guess:
/// a running session takes a paste, a parked one takes an argv on its respawn.
///
/// **Running.** `terminal.send` with the ordered parts list, the envelope
/// suppressed, and the awaiting-input gate opted in. The composer never uses the
/// keys path and never asks for verification.
///
/// **Not running.** `terminal.wake` with the message in its `prompt`, which the
/// daemon passes to the spawn builder as a trailing argument on
/// `claude --resume <id>` — atomic with the respawn, so no paste-readiness
/// question arises. An argument prompt cannot carry image attachments, so each
/// token is replaced inline with its quoted path; Claude reads the files with its
/// Read tool.
///
/// **And then it holds — on its own spawn.** A wake whose session id no longer
/// resolves makes Claude print one line and exit 1 with the prompt lost, while
/// tmux reports the respawn as a success, so the text stays held as *sending*
/// until the session reports in and is restored editable on timeout. But a
/// `SessionStart` on the same terminal is not that evidence: a competing wake, a
/// post-`--fork-session` recapture, and a person typing `claude --resume` in the
/// pane all produce one. The wake result names the incarnation the respawn
/// minted — the id the daemon planted in the child's environment as
/// `TBD_TERMINAL_INCARNATION_ID` and gets back on that process's hooks — and the
/// hold releases on the `SessionStart` carrying that id and on no other. A
/// `SessionStart` with a different id, or with none at all (a worktree's first
/// spawn, an archive restore), leaves it held.
