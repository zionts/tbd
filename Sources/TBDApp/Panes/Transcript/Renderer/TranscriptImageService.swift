///
/// ## Why the decode is off-main
///
/// The transcript has a documented hard-freeze history from expensive work on the
/// main thread (issue #129 — syntax highlighting inside a JavaScriptCore VM, fixed
/// by moving it to `CodeHighlightService`'s background queue). Fully decoding a
/// user's 12-megapixel screenshot is the same class of hazard, so this service
/// never does it: `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` with
/// `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize` downsamples during decode, on a
/// background queue, and only the finished `NSImage` crosses back to main.
///
/// ## Why measurement can stay synchronous
///
/// `CGImageSourceCopyPropertiesAtIndex` reads the file's header — it does not
/// decode pixels — so the true aspect ratio is available BEFORE the thumbnail
/// exists. Row height is therefore exact from the first measurement and does not
/// change when the image arrives. Measured on a 4000×3000 PNG: the cold probe
/// runs in 0.12 ms median / 0.24 ms p95, against 26.4 ms to decode the same file
/// in full — cheap enough to sit inside synchronous row measurement, and the
/// cache below means a scrolled row pays it once.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` is justified by the state: `NSCache` is documented
/// thread-safe, and every other stored property is a `let` of a Sendable type.
