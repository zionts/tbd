/// NSViewControllerRepresentable wrapping NSTabViewController for keep-alive
/// remote-session attach terminals — the remote analogue of `WorktreePager`
/// (see that type's doc comment for why NSTabViewController, not a plain
/// SwiftUI ZStack, is required for correct hit-testing/hidden-state).
///
/// Each mounted tab item owns exactly one live PTY connection to a remote
/// machine (`RemoteAttachTerminalView` → `LocalProcess`) — unlike a local
/// worktree's tmux attach, this is a real, potentially concurrency/cost-
/// bounded resource (SSM/ssh). `mounts` (driven by
/// `AppState.attachedRemoteMountKeys`) is the ONLY mount set this pager
/// ever renders; anything that falls out of it gets torn down
/// (`dismantleNSView` → `Coordinator.cleanup()` → `LocalProcess.terminate()`)
/// on the very next `updateNSViewController`, which is how cap-eviction and
/// explicit-detach both actually free their connection.
///
/// Tab items are keyed by `RemoteAttachMountKey` — selection AND restart
/// generation — not by selection alone. `AppState.reconnectRemoteSession`
/// bumps a selection's generation, so its old key falls out of `mounts` and
/// a new one enters: this one update removes the old item (terminating and
/// reaping its `attach` child; `cleanup()` marks the coordinator torn down, so
/// that child's exit never reaches `onDetached`) and adds a fresh item that
/// re-execs `attach <id>`. The `onDetached` bridge also carries the
/// generation, so an exit that races the swap is dropped by
/// `markRemoteSessionDetached` instead of detaching the replacement.
///
/// Mounted once per `RemoteSessionDetailView` instance and kept alive across
/// DIFFERENT remote-session selections (that view is deliberately no longer
/// `.id()`-keyed per selection — see its doc comment) so switching between
/// recently-viewed sessions doesn't tear down and respawn their terminals.
/// Background attaches ALSO survive leaving remote-session mode entirely
/// (selecting a worktree/repo/scratch section): `RemoteSessionDetailView`
/// itself is now hosted inside `DetailSectionHostPager`'s `.remote` tab,
/// which stays mounted (hidden, not torn down) across that excursion for
/// exactly this reason — see that type's doc comment.
