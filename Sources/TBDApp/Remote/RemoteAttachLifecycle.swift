/// connection process (over SSM/ssh or similar), not a reattach to a tmux
/// session the daemon already keeps running — so both "how many stay live at
/// once" (the cap) and "don't respawn one that just ended" (the

/// consumes this decision's output but isn't itself covered by this type.

    /// Semantics, mirroring `AppState.keepAliveWorktreeIDs`:
    /// - `selected` is the currently viewed session with prior attachment
    ///   intent, filtered by the caller. It is PROTECTED — force
    ///   included when eligible, and does NOT consume `cap`'s budget —
    ///   unless it's ineligible or explicitly detached, in which case it is
    ///   excluded even though it's selected. A session that just detached
    ///   must not silently respawn merely because its row is still the current
    ///   selection (see `explicitlyDetached`).
    /// - Up to `cap` additional entries from `recentlyViewed` (most-recent
    ///   first, excluding whatever `selected` already contributed) stay
    ///   warm so switching back between recently-viewed sessions is instant.
    ///   Beyond the cap, older entries are simply absent from the result —
    ///   the caller (the pager) is expected to tear down anything no longer
    ///   present, which is where the actual eviction/`terminate()` happens.
    /// - `eligible` is a POSITIVE allowlist (not a negative "ineligible"
    ///   exclusion list) so a selection this function has never heard of —
    ///   an unregistered provider, a session absent from the mirror
    ///   entirely — defaults to NOT attachable rather than accidentally
    ///   attachable. Callers compute it from capability ("attach" declared)
    ///   AND liveness (`!gone`).
    /// - `explicitlyDetached` overrides eligibility in both directions: even
    ///   `selected` is excluded while flagged, and eviction from the warm
    ///   cache never happens for the OPPOSITE reason (a session doesn't need
    ///   to be "explicitly detached" to be evicted — plain cap pressure
    ///   already handles that via `recentlyViewed`'s ordering).
    /// - `pendingReconnect` is the same kind of override as
    ///   `explicitlyDetached` (excludes even a protected `selected`), but for
    ///   a DIFFERENT reason: a session whose attach ended UNEXPECTEDLY
    ///   (transport failure, not a user detach) rather than being flagged
    ///   forever. The caller (`AppState.attachedRemoteSelections`) computes
    ///   this set fresh from `RemoteReconnectPolicy.isBlocked` against
    ///   current provider health + backoff, so a selection leaves this set
    ///   on its own once the provider recovers — no explicit gesture
    ///   required, unlike `explicitlyDetached`.
