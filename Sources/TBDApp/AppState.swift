    // themselves called from `body`, would also close a self-invalidation
    // loop. `AppState` is `@MainActor`, so plain storage is race-free here.
    //
    // Invalidation is the two `didSet`s above. Every mutation site in the app
    // goes through these stored properties — including in-place element writes
    // like `worktrees[key]?[idx].pinSortOrder = order`, which are a
    // get-modify-set on the stored property and therefore fire `didSet` too —
    // so there is no bypassing path.
    //
    // THE WARM-CACHE DEPENDENCY TRAP. Untracked storage means a cache hit
    // reads nothing observable, and under Observation SwiftUI rebuilds a
    // view's dependency set from what each `body` evaluation actually read.
    // A body served entirely from a warm cache would therefore *drop* its
    // dependency on `worktrees`, and the next write to it would not
    // invalidate that view — the sidebar going stale until some other
    // property it reads happens to change. Both getters below defeat this by
    // touching their tracked source unconditionally, before consulting the
    // cache, so every evaluation re-registers the dependency whether it hits
    // or misses. The touch costs a retain, not a copy.
    //
    // `AppStateWarmCacheDependencySourceTests` pins this: it warms the cache
    // through a re-evaluation it proves happened, then asserts a `worktrees`
