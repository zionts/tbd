# TBD

macOS native worktree + terminal manager for multi-agent Claude Code workflows.

Use the `tbd-project` skill for architecture, conventions, and file reference.

## ⚠️ Public repo, multi-tenant product

**This repository is public, and TBD is used by people across different organizations.** Never commit private context — real employer, org, repo, host, account, person, or ticket names, internal URLs, or machine-specific paths (use `acme` / `acme-prod` placeholders). **Whatever a session is working on elsewhere — product features, roadmaps, ticket and task descriptions — is likely confidential to that org and must not leak here**, in docs, specs, tests, fixtures, or commit messages. Never build or document for one repo, one project, or one person's workflow: features, defaults, and docs must generalize.

## Nightwatch is being replaced — two paths until cutover

The fleet-supervision subsystem ("Nightwatch"/"Daywatch") is being redesigned
from scratch. The target design is
[`docs/specs/2026-07-26-fleet-supervision-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-07-26-fleet-supervision-design.md)
(requirements: [`docs/specs/2026-07-26-fleet-supervision-requirements.md`](docs/specs/2026-07-26-fleet-supervision-requirements.md)).
The redesign builds a second path alongside the existing implementation;
cutover happens when the new path holds up, and both paths are live until
then. New supervision features should ideally land in both: in the existing
implementation where they're needed now, and in the new design's structures —
where the new-path half is usually user-land (a playbook, sweep-program, or
wake-program change) rather than compiled (see "Compile only what user-land
cannot do well" below).

## Main Session Agent

The main chat session agent should not write code directly. Delegate all implementation work to suitable subagents (Agent tool). The main session focuses on planning, coordination, and reviewing subagent results.

## Workflow

- Only stage and commit files you actually changed — never commit unrelated or other agents' modifications.
- Always commit after completing work. Don't wait to be asked.
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- PR descriptions follow [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): pick the variant that matches the change (refactors, DX, and ops use the feature skeleton, with Summary carrying the motivation) and replace the guidance comments with prose.
- For a chain of dependent PRs — creating, linking, restacking, or merging one — use the `stacked-prs` skill ([`.claude/skills/stacked-prs/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/stacked-prs/SKILL.md)); it records GitHub's stack CLI and API plus this repo's required-check quirks.
- A PR (or GitLab MR) opened from a TBD worktree ends its body with that worktree's deep-link, so the PR can be traced back to the session that produced it: get the UUID with `tbd link 2>/dev/null || tbd link "$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")"`, take the `?worktree=<uuid>` portion, and make the last line `[<worktree display name>](https://cheapsteak.github.io/tbd/open/?worktree=<uuid>)`. Outside TBD, or when `tbd link` fails, skip it silently — it is never a blocker. (A guardrail rule, `pr-worktree-link`, nudges about this on `gh pr create` and `glab mr create`.)
- Banned words — never use these in code or in PR titles, descriptions, or commit messages: "blessed", "golden"
- No prose tables in markdown docs — use lists (bolded lead term, en-dash, prose; nested bullets when a row has several fields). A table is acceptable only when its cells are mostly short numerical or scannable values: counts, defaults, thresholds, old→new line numbers. Prose crammed into cells gets squished and unreadable.
- Spec and doc edits must leave a document that stands alone for a first-time reader. Never write revision history into prose: no "Amended \<date\>" notes, no "an earlier draft…" retracing, no reversal narratives — rewrite the superseded passage to state the current design as if it were always so; git history is the archive. Keep **evidence** ("field measurement showed X"), drop **chronology** ("removed \<date\> after review Y"). A rejected-alternatives section is welcome as timeless why-not rationale — written as rationale, never as a revision log. The one exemption is an **as-built audit record** of an existing system (e.g. [`docs/nightwatch.md`](docs/nightwatch.md)): there, dated banners recording what was measured against which tree are the evidence, and the document must declare that purpose at the top.
- Verify your changes compile (`scripts/swift-safe build`) before committing.
- **`swift package resolve` can print `error:` on a run that succeeded.** SwiftPM removes a dependency checkout by unlinking it in place; a removal that doesn't complete leaves a tree the next resolve reads as "has uncommitted changes" and refuses to finish removing — gone from `Package.resolved`, still on disk, `error:` on stderr, **exit 0**. So an `error:` line in resolve output is not by itself evidence that the resolve failed: check the exit code, and to confirm the workspace really is clean compare `.build/checkouts` against the `identity` values in `Package.resolved` — they should match exactly (case-insensitively).
- Run `scripts/test.sh` if you changed daemon or shared code. It fences the run
  against the developer's real `~/tbd` and `~/.claude` (see "Tests must not
  touch ~/tbd") and invokes SwiftPM through `scripts/swift-safe`, which
  serializes builds across TBD worktrees and defaults to two compiler jobs —
  the machine's owner can raise that by exporting `TBD_SWIFT_JOBS` (builds are
  serialized, so it is a machine-wide ceiling: e.g. 8 on a 12-core machine);
  raw `swift build/test/run` is blocked by the repo guardrail because
  concurrent default `-j12` builds can exhaust this development machine. The
  two wrappers are orthogonal — admission control and filesystem isolation —
  and compose rather than replace each other.
- **When the local build queue is starving a test run, `scripts/test.sh` can get
  the verdict from CI instead.** This *remote verification valve* is default-off;
  arm it by exporting `TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY=1` in the shell your test runs start
  from. Armed, a run that has queued for the machine-global build slot for
  `TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY_YIELD_SECONDS` (default 300) **without ever acquiring it**
  gives up its place, pushes the commit to an inert `preflight/` ref, and reports
  the verdict CI returns. It bounds **queue** time, never run time, so a yield
  discards nothing — a wait that never acquired the slot has compiled nothing —
  and 300 is sized against GitHub's macOS concurrency rather than impatience.
  Four things about it are easy to state wrongly and each is load-bearing:
  - **It is an optimisation, never a gate.** A refused precondition (dirty tree,
    no `gh`, no pushable ref) exits 78, names itself, and the run falls back to
    the local queue. A refusal must never fail a run.
  - **75 is not 76.** 76 means "yielded the queue, verify remotely" and is the
    only status that routes. 75 means the wait timed out or was abandoned; it is
    propagated untouched, it is **not** green, and it is not a request to verify
    elsewhere. Conflating the two is a silent wrong answer.
  - **Only `scripts/test.sh` opts in**, because its whole output is a verdict.
    `scripts/restart.sh` and every other artifact build stay local permanently —
    a binary has to land on this disk.
  - **A remote run is always the whole suite**; the dispatch cannot carry
    `--filter`. A green whole-suite verdict is sound for a narrowed caller, since
    every subset of a passing suite passes. A red one is not — the failures may
    lie outside what the caller selected — so a narrowed run that comes back red
    is re-run locally and the local verdict is the one reported.

  The knobs, the capacity model behind 300, and the soak evidence graduation
  waits on: [`docs/specs/2026-08-16-remote-verification-valve-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-16-remote-verification-valve-design.md).
- When adding a branching conditional that gates behavior (feature flags, toggles, mode switches), add a test for each branch. Verify the gated behavior is off when the flag is off, and that ungated behavior still works.

### Compile only what user-land cannot do well

Compiled behavior is the hardest kind to change: it ships by rebuild and release, and a flagged default needs a forcing migration to flip later. User-land surfaces — CLI output, hooks, seeded reference scripts, files under `~/tbd/repos/<repoID>/` — change by editing a file. So when deciding where new behavior lives, default to exposing the facts and actuations that make it possible outside the daemon, and compile the behavior itself only when user-land cannot do it well (per-event cost across a whole fleet, liveness attestation, integrity of the record). Capability migrates inward only on field evidence, one piece at a time — the Built/Enabled ratchet in `docs/specs/2026-07-26-fleet-supervision-requirements.md`. Motivations for wanting a change differ case by case; the placement rule does not.

### Large or risky new behavior ships behind a default-off flag

New features that act autonomously or can destroy state land gated behind a flag that defaults to OFF, soak, and only then graduate (flip the default, eventually delete the flag). Required when the feature:

- acts without a user gesture — background sweeps, timers, anything "auto-"
- kills processes, deletes or mutates persisted state, or sends input to sessions
- wholesale-replaces a load-bearing path (rendering, input routing, persistence)

Not required for bug fixes, small additive UI, or refactors — don't sprawl flags.

Mechanics: daemon-side behavior gates on a `config` column added by migration (follow "Database migrations must update the shared model" below); app-only behavior may gate on a UserDefaults key (precedent: `enableTranscript`, default-off). Test both branches (see Workflow above). State the flag name, how to enable it for the soak, and the graduation plan in the PR description.

**Add the column with no SQL default, so "unset" stays a third state.** In a `.sql` migration write `ALTER TABLE config ADD COLUMN <flag>_enabled INTEGER;` with no `DEFAULT` clause; in the Swift escape hatch call `addColumnIfMissing(table:column:type:)` and omit `defaults:`. NULL then means nobody has chosen, `0`/`1` mean somebody did, and the shipped default lives in exactly one place: the `?? Config.<flag>Default` in `ConfigRecord.toModel()`. Graduation becomes a one-line change to that constant — it reaches everyone who never touched the toggle and preserves every explicit opt-out. Test that the three states are distinguishable: a pre-migration row must read NULL rather than `0`, and an explicit `false` must survive a change to the default constant while NULL follows it.

Cautionary precedent, and the reason for that rule: `auto_hibernate_enabled` shipped default-ON in `v39_session_hibernation` and had to be force-disabled in `v50` once the eat-typed-input risk was understood. Passing `defaults:` makes `ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT` backfill existing rows, so flipping a default later needs a forcing `UPDATE` migration (a Swift-side default change alone is a no-op for existing installs) — and after the force-off, a user's deliberate opt-in was indistinguishable from the backfilled value, so it got reset too. Every flag added before `queued_prompt_enabled` carries `defaults: false` and has this defect: its `?? false` fallback is unreachable in any real install, because the singleton `config` row is seeded naming only two columns (`Database.swift`) and takes the schema default for everything else. Those flags are not retrofittable — the distinction was destroyed on write, and migrating `0` to NULL would read every deliberate opt-out as "never chose". Shipping default-OFF first still matters independently. Good precedents for the OFF-first half: `control_mode_enabled`, `hibernate_input_veto_enabled` (v51).

### Work starts with a brainstormed spec

Decisions must be examinable — changes to our theory of the system or the product most of all. Code expresses a theory; a diff shows what changed, not why the theory did. So anything that is not a bug fix or a minor UI change runs `/tbd-brainstorming` **before** implementation and commits the spec to `docs/specs/<date>-<topic>-design.md`. If it needs a flag, it needs a spec.

**Prior design does not exempt.** Thinking done in prototypes, a report, another repo, or an earlier session makes the spec a cheap transcription — not an unnecessary one. Reviewers here cannot read that material, so those decisions are the ones that most need writing down.

**A human answers the brainstorming questions.** An agent may not answer its own. If none is available, stop — do not proceed on assumed answers. Agents, including the nightwatch desk, may not originate feature work; file it for a human instead.

Bug fixes and minor UI changes need no spec — a bug fix restores the system to its existing theory, while the work that needs a spec is the work that revises it. If a larger change genuinely needs none, say so in the PR description. This is convention, not a gate — no linter can see whether thinking happened. In Claude Code use `/tbd-brainstorming`, not `superpowers:brainstorming`; a guardrail redirects the wrong one. Codex has no slash command for it — read `.claude/skills/tbd-brainstorming/SKILL.md` and follow it directly.

### Restart must use the worktree's own script
Always run `scripts/restart.sh` (relative, from the worktree cwd), never an absolute path to the main project's copy. Using `/Users/chang/projects/tbd/scripts/restart.sh` builds and starts binaries from the main branch, leaving old worktree processes running and causing "Unknown method" RPC errors. After any restart, verify with:
```
ps aux | grep -E "\.build/debug/TBD" | grep -v grep
```
There should be exactly one `TBDDaemon` and one `TBDApp`, both from the worktree path. If stale processes exist: `pkill -f TBDDaemon; pkill -f TBDApp` then re-run `scripts/restart.sh`.

## Critical Rules

### NEVER delete ~/tbd/state.db
The database stores worktree display names, custom config, and notification history. Deleting it orphans tmux servers (repo UUID changes → tmux server name changes → old sessions become unreachable). If you encounter DB issues, diagnose and fix the schema/code — don't wipe the DB.

### Tests must not touch ~/tbd
`TBDConstants.configDir` and `socketPath` honor two env vars so tests, CI, and concurrent `swift test` runs across worktrees never collide with the live daemon or the developer's real config:

- `TBD_HOME` redirects the base config directory (`~/tbd` by default). Every derived path (`socketPath`, `databasePath`, `pidFilePath`, `portFilePath`, `reposDir`) follows.
- `TBD_SOCKET_PATH` overrides only the socket — an escape hatch for darwin's ~104-char `sun_path` limit when `TBD_HOME` is a deep tmp path.

Integration-style tests that exercise production code paths which internally read `TBD_HOME` — and thus cannot accept an explicit env dict — may use `setenv("TBD_HOME", "/some/tmp/dir", 1)` (and optionally `TBD_SOCKET_PATH`); for all other cases prefer the injection-seam approach, and see the next paragraph for where `setenv` is permitted. Tests that mutate `UserDefaults` should construct `AppState(userDefaults: UserDefaults(suiteName:))` and tear the suite down with `removePersistentDomain(forName:)` — `UserDefaults.standard` on this unbundled executable is the developer's real `TBDApp.plist`.

For unit tests, prefer injection seams over `setenv`: pass an explicit env dict to `TBDConstants.*(environment:)`, override the themes directory via `ThemeStore(themesDirectory:)` or `AppearanceSettings(userThemesDirectory:)`, override the profile/host claude dirs via `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager(baseDirectory:hostBaseDirectory:)` (`makeIsolatedConfigDirManager(tag:)` in `TestSupport`). **`setenv("TBD_HOME", ...)` in tests is allowed ONLY inside suites nested under `TBDHomeSerialized` in `Tests/TBDDaemonTests`.** All test targets compile into one process and Swift Testing runs suites in parallel across all targets; an unserialized `setenv` in any other target races every concurrent suite — this was the root cause of a real CI flake in `ConstantsTests.derivedPathsFollowTBDHome`.

**Run tests with `scripts/test.sh`, not bare `swift test`.** It forwards its arguments to `swift test` behind two layers. The **fence** (always on) points `TBD_HOME`, `TBD_SOCKET_PATH`, `TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME`, `TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME` and `TMUX_TMPDIR` at a scratch dir, and `HOME`/`CFFIXED_USER_HOME` at a second one whose `tbd`, `.claude` and `.codex` entries are mode `000`. `TBD_TEST_SCRATCH_ROOT` names that first scratch dir itself — the one the EXIT trap deletes — so the handful of fixtures that must mint a short socket-bearing root of their own can nest it there and be reclaimed even when the run is killed. The two host-store legs matter as much as the first: a default-constructed `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager` otherwise gets a scratch profiles dir and the developer's real `~/.claude` as the host store it moves subtrees around in, and `CodexHomeManager` falls back to the real `~/.codex` and writes a plugin, hooks and a profile TOML into it. `TMUX_TMPDIR` fences the shared `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`, which every `-L <name>` resolves under, and it is the one leak no teardown can undo: **tmux never unlinks its socket file when a server exits** — it unlinks a stale one lazily when a new server claims that exact path, and every test mints a fresh name, so ~7,100 dead sockets accumulated in nine days. Keep the fenced directory directly under the short `/tmp` scratch root or the socket path outgrows `sun_path`. The **detector** fingerprints the real `~/tbd`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` and tmux socket directory on either side and fails the run if any entry appeared or vanished; it is on when `$CI` is set, off otherwise, `--fingerprint` opts in locally and `--no-fingerprint` forces it off. It is CI-shaped because on a developer box a live daemon, sibling worktrees and concurrent agent sessions write to those directories legitimately throughout a run, and a guard that reddens spuriously gets disabled. The rule above had been in this file all along and the suite violated it anyway — 18k orphan profile dirs and ~2.9k fake worktrees accumulated unnoticed — because the invariant belongs to a whole run and no per-test assertion can express it. The wrapper's guards have their own mutation-checked harness, `scripts/test.test.sh` (~11 s, no build, no real store touched), wired into the `lint` CI job — edit a guard, edit its case.

Two shapes cause that leak, and both are worth recognizing:

- **A static/ambient helper that ignores its caller's injected seam.** `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager.resolveConfigDir` was `static` and built its own manager on `TBDConstants.configDir`, so every caller's injected temp-dir manager was decorative. If a type takes an injected collaborator, its path helpers must be instance members — do not add a static twin "for convenience".
- **A path hand-built from `$HOME`.** `WorktreeLayout.basePath` composed `"\(home)/tbd/worktrees/…"` itself, so it silently ignored `TBD_HOME` and defeated the fence. Derive every TBD-owned path from `TBDConstants`.

**Teardown must restore `TBD_HOME`, `TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME` and `TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME`, never `unsetenv` them.** Unsetting does not return to the harness's scratch home — it returns to the developer's real `~/tbd`, `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`, process-wide, for every concurrently running suite. Use `setTBDHome(_:)` / `restoreTBDHome(_:)`, `setClaudeHostHome(_:)` / `restoreClaudeHostHome(_:)` and `setCodexTestHome(_:)` / `restoreCodexTestHome(_:)` from `TestSupport`, and mutate any of the three only from a suite nested under `TBDHomeSerialized`.

### Database migrations must update the shared model
When adding a DB column:
1. Add the column in a new migration file under `Sources/TBDDaemon/Database/Migrations/`. Omit the SQL `DEFAULT` clause unless every existing row genuinely wants that value backfilled — feature flags always omit it, per the rule above.
2. Update the GRDB Record type in `Sources/TBDDaemon/Database/`
3. Update the Codable model in `Sources/TBDShared/Models.swift` — new fields MUST be optional or have a default value so existing JSON/rows still decode
4. All three changes in the same commit

Migrations run through GRDB's `DatabaseMigrator`. A new one is a `.sql` file named `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_lower_snake.sql`, whose stem is the migration identifier — one file per migration, so parallel branches can neither pick the same identifier nor edit the same text. Never modify or delete a migration that has landed; add a new one. `scripts/lint-migrations.py` enforces the naming, the statement allowlist, and the freeze. The frozen Swift block, the escape hatch for procedural migrations, and the rest of the conventions: [`Sources/TBDDaemon/Database/CLAUDE.md`](Sources/TBDDaemon/Database/CLAUDE.md).

### Per-repo config: two storage patterns

- **DB columns** (`config` / `repo` tables) for small structured settings the daemon resolves at spawn time: `envOverrides`, profile override, feature flags.
- **Files under `~/tbd/repos/<repoID>/`** for user-authored editable blobs: hooks, `notes.md`, `claude-settings.json`. Path helpers live in `TBDConstants` (`hookPath`, `notesPath`, `claudeSettingsOverlayPath`) and honor `TBD_HOME`.

File-backed settings editors in the app write the file directly (no RPC) and must show the tilde-abbreviated backing path with a copy-path button — see `RepoHooksSettingsView`. Don't add a DB column for a user-authored blob (PR #452's `claude_settings_overlay` column had to be swept back out to a file).

### Unbundled executable constraints
TBDApp runs as a bare SPM executable, not a `.app` bundle. APIs that require a bundle identifier will crash at runtime. Before using any Apple framework API, check whether it requires a bundle:
- `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()` — crashes without `CFBundleIdentifier`
- `NSApp.applicationIconImage` — must be set *after* `setActivationPolicy(.regular)`
- Any API that reads `Info.plist` keys — will return nil

Guard these with `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier != nil` checks.

### Deep links and TBD.app bundle

`tbd://open?worktree=<uuid>` URL clicks reach the app via the `.app` bundle assembled by `scripts/restart.sh` at `.build/debug/TBD.app`. Two consequences:

- **Bundled launch is required.** `swift run TBDApp` and direct execution of `.build/debug/TBDApp` produce a process with no surrounding `Info.plist`, so LaunchServices won't deliver `tbd://` URLs to it. Always launch via `scripts/restart.sh` when testing deep links.
- **One worktree wins LaunchServices.** All TBD worktrees register the same `CFBundleIdentifier=com.github.cheapsteak.tbd`, so whichever worktree most recently ran `restart.sh` becomes the `tbd://` handler. Restart the worktree you want to receive links — others stay built but inert for URL routing.

### NIO thread safety
All `ChannelHandlerContext` property access (`context.channel`, `context.pipeline`) must happen on the channel's event loop. Accessing from any other thread triggers a precondition crash. Always wrap in `context.eventLoop.execute { ... }` — never use `context.channel.isActive` as a pre-check outside the event loop.

### Every durable external resource needs a named reconciler
Creation against git, tmux, the process table, or the filesystem cannot be transactional — the external system commits before TBD records the intent, and a crash, a cancellation, or a partial failure in between leaves a resource nobody owns. Creation-time rollback is therefore best-effort everywhere; the standing guarantee is a background sweep that compares ground truth against intent and reclaims the difference. Three reconcilers carry that load:

- **`OrphanGC`** (`Sources/TBDDaemon/GC/OrphanGC.swift`) – hourly when `gcEnabled` (the default), over agent worktrees, scratchpads, the deletion queue, and stale git registrations. Also over per-profile config directories under `~/tbd/profiles/`, gated additionally by `gcProfileDirsEnabled` (default off during soak) and reclaiming by quarantine rather than deletion — see [`docs/specs/2026-08-15-profile-dir-gc-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-15-profile-dir-gc-design.md); and over hang-stack diagnostics in `~/Library/Logs/TBD/hang-stacks/`, gated additionally by `gcHangStacksEnabled` (default off during soak) and bounded to 14 days and 1000 files — see [`docs/specs/2026-08-29-hang-stack-reclaimer-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-29-hang-stack-reclaimer-design.md). And over pty-holder rendezvous files under `~/tbd/holders/` — the socket a SIGKILLed holder could not unlink, plus its sibling lock and log — under `gcEnabled` like the agent-worktree loop, and keep-biased for young sockets; see [`docs/specs/2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md).
- **`AgentReaper`** (`Sources/TBDDaemon/Process/AgentReaper.swift`) – every 60 seconds, over orphaned agent processes. Its tmux leg enumerates children of tmux server pids; its holder leg (`sweepHolderChildren`, unflagged like the tmux leg) instead sweeps by each holder session's recorded child pid, because a holder's job re-parents to launchd and no enumeration rooted at a tmux server can reach it. That leg verifies process identity — start time against the session row, plus the executable — before signalling anything, and keeps whenever identity is uncertain.
- **`WorktreeLifecycle+Reconcile`** (`Sources/TBDDaemon/Lifecycle/WorktreeLifecycle+Reconcile.swift`) – at startup and on demand, reconciling DB rows against git worktrees and tmux windows and servers.

What `tbd update` leaves under `~/tbd/updates/` sits outside all three on purpose, because neither entry can accumulate. `src` is one long-lived clone that every update reuses: `scripts/reclaim-build.sh` never scans it and it appears in nobody's `git worktree list`. `previous/TBD.app` is exactly one app bundle, the one the last update replaced, overwritten by the next update and deliberately kept as the no-rebuild route back. Removing either is an operator gesture, and the next update recreates it — see [`docs/updating.md`](docs/updating.md).

There is deliberately no transactional or saga abstraction; the sweeps are the mechanism, and we are not adding one.

A PR that introduces a new *kind* of durable resource, or a new creation path for one — a git ref or worktree, a tmux server or window, a spawned process, a file or directory that outlives the request that created it — must answer who reclaims its orphans, in one of three ways: name the reconciler that covers it (usually by extending one of the three), state in the PR description why an orphan cannot arise, or point to a committed spec that deliberately chose create-time cleanup instead — [`docs/specs/2026-08-14-worktree-add-failure-cleanup-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-14-worktree-add-failure-cleanup-design.md) withdraws a branch its own failed `git worktree add` created from the failing call itself, and from no sweep, timer, or background pass. A sweep is not mandatory; answering the question explicitly is. Routine call sites that create a resource through a path an existing reconciler already covers need no answer — they are covered already.

The field evidence is why the question gets asked: every unbounded leak found in the wild sat on a resource no sweep covered — 2,804 leaked git branches, and ~7,100 dead tmux socket files that no teardown can unlink — while every resource a reconciler does cover has stayed healthy regardless of how good its rollback path was. Ad-hoc `try?` cleanup on the deletion path is still worth writing, but it has never been sufficient on its own. Full rationale, the judgment calibration for "new kind" versus routine call site, and the rejected alternatives: [`docs/specs/2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md).

### No `print()` in `Sources/`
Applies to `TBDShared`, `TBDDaemonLib`, `TBDDaemon`, and `TBDApp`. **`TBDCLI` is intentionally excluded** — its `print()` calls are user-facing CLI output (stdout for human consumption + scripting), not diagnostic logging.

Use `os.Logger` (`import os`) with one of the established subsystems (`com.tbd.app`, `com.tbd.daemon`) and a feature-shaped category. `.debug` is the right level for traces you'd previously have used `print()` for — they're silent by default and activated with `log stream --level debug`. Always pass an explicit `privacy:` argument on dynamic interpolations (default `.public` for this dev tool, `.private`/`.sensitive` for secrets). Full rationale and category taxonomy: [`docs/diagnostics-strategy.md`](docs/diagnostics-strategy.md).

This rule is enforced mechanically by SwiftLint (custom rule `no_print_in_sources`) in the dedicated `lint` CI job and the pre-push git hook, both invoking a Homebrew-installed `swiftlint --strict` directly. To lint manually: `swiftlint --strict`. Prerequisite: `brew install swiftlint`. See `.swiftlint.yml`.

### New delays and timers take an injected clock

Anything that sleeps, debounces, polls, or times out takes the clock as its last initializer parameter, defaulted so no call site changes:

```swift
init(..., clock: any Clock<Duration> = ContinuousClock())
```

Existential, not generic — a generic parameter would infect the actor types these subsystems already carry `Sendable` conformances on. Timestamps that get *persisted or compared* use the separate date seam instead (`date: Date = Date()` on the method, or `now: @Sendable () -> Date` on the type): **`Duration` is behavior, `Date` is data.**

Enforced mechanically by the SwiftLint rule `no_raw_task_sleep` (same `lint` job and pre-push hook as `no_print_in_sources`). Pre-existing sites carry a visible `// swiftlint:disable:next no_raw_task_sleep - legacy sleep, …` suppression and are being burned down; adding a new one draws review scrutiny. `PollerClock` is a sanctioned exception for suspend-aware *wall*-deadline sleeping and is not a template. Seam details, test helpers, and the existential's `Instant` limitation: [`Tests/CLAUDE.md`](Tests/CLAUDE.md) "Clock and date seams".

### No TUI screen-scraping

Never infer an agent's state by parsing its rendered terminal screen — tmux `capture-pane` text, composer glyphs like `❯`, placeholder or status strings. Screen text is a display surface, not an API: scraping breaks *silently* when the TUI changes copy or rendering, couples TBD to one agent version, and sits at the wrong layer. Get agent state from machine interfaces instead: Claude Code hooks, transcript JSONL, tmux control-mode events, process exit codes, or TBD's own DB/RPC state. (Cautionary tale: PR #398 verified submits by scanning the composer line for `[Pasted text` — it defended an unreachable state and was removed as dead code.)

Enforced mechanically by two SwiftLint custom rules in `.swiftlint.yml` (`no_tui_scraping_literals`, `capture_pane_allowlist`), which run in the `lint` CI job and the pre-push hook. Three sanctioned scrapers predate this rule and are excluded with comments (interactive `/login` driving, the pending-input hibernation rail, the embedded Nightwatch babysitter) — they should eventually migrate off screen text. Adding a **new** exclusion requires a compelling justification in the PR description; the PR review gate treats unjustified additions as High severity.

### Changing the PR-review merge gate
`claude-review` is a required check on `main`, produced by the `claude-review` job in `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` — a fan-out pipeline whose verdict is computed by scripts under `.github/workflows/claude-review-v2/` (`prepare.py`, `validate.py`, `render_comment.py`) rather than typed by the model. Before touching that workflow or those scripts, read [`docs/pr-review-gate.md`](docs/pr-review-gate.md) and the design spec [`docs/specs/2026-08-03-pr-review-fanout-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-08-03-pr-review-fanout-design.md). Three traps they document: the workflow runs on `pull_request_target` and **must** pass `github_token` (the OIDC app-token exchange 401s on that trigger); changing the workflow's *trigger event* requires a one-time **admin merge** (such a PR matches neither the old nor new event, so no review runs and the required check never reports); and branch protection matches the required check by **job name**, so exactly one job in `.github/workflows/` may be named `claude-review` — the retired single-session reviewer is kept in `claude-code-review-legacy.yml` with its job named `claude-review-legacy` and `workflow_dispatch` as its only trigger. It is a **restoration source, not a fallback you can run**: dispatching it exits at the fork gate without reviewing anything, because there is no `pull_request` payload outside a PR event; reviving it means re-adding the trigger and renaming the job. The `<!-- claude-review-v2 -->` comment sentinel and the `claude-review-v2/` directory name are live state matched verbatim on every open PR; don't rename either.

## Quick Reference

- **Build**: `scripts/swift-safe build`
- **Test**: `scripts/test.sh` (fences `~/tbd`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` and the tmux socket dir, then runs SwiftPM through `scripts/swift-safe`)
- **Restart**: `scripts/restart.sh`
- **Update the installation to the latest `main`**: `tbd update` (`scripts/update.sh`); see [`docs/updating.md`](docs/updating.md)
- **Send a starving test run to CI instead of waiting**: `export TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY=1` (default off; needs a clean tree). See the remote verification valve under "Workflow" above.
- **Install git hooks** (one-time setup after cloning): `scripts/install-hooks.sh`
- **Run the real `claude` with zero tokens** (fake model API): `scripts/claude-stub.py -- -p "hi"` — see [`docs/fake-model-api.md`](docs/fake-model-api.md); every test double the repo has: [`docs/test-doubles.md`](docs/test-doubles.md)
- **Diagnostics**: see [`docs/diagnostics-strategy.md`](docs/diagnostics-strategy.md). Quick recipes:
  - Stream one feature area live: `log stream --level debug --predicate 'subsystem BEGINSWITH "com.tbd" AND category == "markdown"'`
  - Replay the last 5 minutes after reproducing a bug: `log show --last 5m --level debug --predicate 'subsystem BEGINSWITH "com.tbd"'` (requires `sudo log config --subsystem com.tbd.app --mode "level:debug,persist:debug"` once per subsystem to capture `.debug` rows)
