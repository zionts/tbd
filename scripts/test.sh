#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# The test suite, with the developer's real `~/tbd`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`
# and tmux socket directory fenced off.
#
# SwiftPM is invoked through `scripts/swift-safe`, never directly: that wrapper
# holds a machine-global admission lock and bounds compiler jobs so concurrent
# TBD worktrees cannot each start a full compiler swarm, and the repo guardrail
# blocks raw `swift build/test/run` for that reason. The two wrappers solve
# orthogonal problems — admission control there, filesystem isolation here — and
# every argument this script does not consume is forwarded through to
# `swift test`.
#
# STACKING THEM TAKES ONE EXPLICIT LINE, and leaving it out silently disarms the
# admission half. `swift-safe` derives its lock from `$TBD_HOME/runtime/…` when
# `TBD_SWIFT_LOCK_PATH` is unset — and the fence below points `TBD_HOME` at a
# `mktemp -d` that is unique per invocation, so every fenced run would take a
# PRIVATE lock and two concurrent runs would never serialize. That is precisely
# the compiler swarm `swift-safe` exists to prevent, arriving through the
# wrapper that is supposed to compose with it. So `TBD_SWIFT_LOCK_PATH` is
# pinned below, computed from the REAL home before the `env` prefix overrides it
# and passed explicitly — never left for `swift-safe` to derive from an
# environment this script has already rewritten.
#
# Three layers. The first two are always on; the third is CI-only.
#
#   1. CONTAINMENT — always on. `TBD_HOME`, `TBD_SOCKET_PATH`,
#      `TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME` and `TMUX_TMPDIR` point at a fresh scratch dir
#      for the whole run, so any code path that resolves a TBD-owned path — or
#      the host Claude store a profile dir mirrors, or a tmux socket — lands
#      there instead of in the real one. This catches leaks nobody has
#      diagnosed yet, including ones in code that has no injection seam at all.
#      `TBD_TEST_SCRATCH_ROOT` names that scratch dir itself, for the handful of
#      fixtures that must mint a socket-bearing root of their own (see
#      "NAMING THE RUN ROOT" beside the `env` prefix below).
#   2. THE TRIPWIRE — always on. `HOME` and `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` point at a
#      *different* directory from layer 1, and the two names a leak reaches for
#      inside it — `tbd` and `.claude` — are pre-created mode `000`. Code that
#      asks the fence where home is lands in layer 1's scratch and works; code
#      that assembles a path out of the home directory instead gets `EACCES` at
#      the exact call site, inside the failing test, with the offending path in
#      the error. See "READING A PERMISSION-DENIED FAILURE" below.
#   3. DETECTION — on in CI (`$CI` set), off elsewhere; `--fingerprint` opts in
#      locally and `--no-fingerprint` forces it off anywhere. The real `~/tbd`,
#      `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/Library/Logs/TBD/hang-stacks` and the tmux
#      socket directory are fingerprinted before and after, and a changed
#      fingerprint fails the run even when
#      every test passed. This is now a backstop rather than the primary
#      guard; see "WHY THE TRIPWIRE SUPERSEDES THE FINGERPRINT".
#
# WHAT THE FENCE CANNOT DO ON ITS OWN: KILL A PROCESS. Containment is about
# paths, and two of the things a run leaves behind are not files. A tmux server
# outlives the socket that named it, and a `TBDHolder` outlives the test process
# that spawned it BY DESIGN — it calls `setsid()` and ignores `SIGHUP` so it can
# survive the daemon's death (`Sources/TBDHolder/Holder.swift`), which means it
# survives a killed test process just as well, re-parents to launchd, and keeps
# its job running. Deleting the scratch root does not touch either one. So
# `cleanup` sweeps both by resource — a `kill-server` per socket file, and a
# `kill -9` for whoever `lsof` says holds each holder rendezvous socket — before
# the `rm -rf`, and never by name pattern: this machine runs live production
# holders and other people's agents, and a `pkill -f` on the holder's name would
# end them.
#
# AND THE RUN THAT NEVER REACHES ITS OWN TRAP. `trap cleanup EXIT` fires on a
# fatal signal as well as a normal exit, but nothing in-process runs after a
# SIGKILL, a panic or a power cut — and a holder inside that abandoned root
# keeps running with nobody left who remembers it. Nothing in the product
# reclaims one: `OrphanGC` enumerates the real `~/tbd/holders` and `AgentReaper`
# works from `terminal` rows, and a fixture's socket is under a scratch root
# with no row anywhere. `reclaim_abandoned_run_roots` is the named reconciler
# for that case (docs/specs/2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md): at
# START-UP, every sibling run root that is both older than a day AND has no live
# owner gets the same two sweeps and then `rm -rf`. Every run is a sweep, so the
# machine heals as soon as anybody tests again. The liveness half is not
# redundant with the age half: a WEDGED run stops writing, so it ages exactly
# like an abandoned one, and only the pid it claimed its root with can tell them
# apart.
#
# READING A PERMISSION-DENIED FAILURE. If a test under this wrapper fails with
# "You don't have permission to save the file …" or `EACCES`/`NSFileWriteNoPermissionError`
# on a path ending in `/tbd/…` or `/.claude/…`, that is not a broken machine and
# not a bad scratch dir. It means: **this code assembled a path out of the home
# directory instead of asking `TBDConstants`.** On a developer box the same code
# would have written into the real `~/tbd` or `~/.claude`. The fix is to route
# the path through `TBDConstants` (or whatever injected seam the type already
# takes) — never to relax the decoy's mode, and never to point `HOME` back at
# the real one.
#
# WHY BOTH FENCE VARS, AND WHY `HOME` ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. They cover disjoint
# halves and neither substitutes for the other. Measured here on macOS 26.1:
#
#   - `$HOME` does NOT fence Foundation. CoreFoundation's home lookup tries
#     `CFFIXED_USER_HOME`, then `getpwuid`, and only then `$HOME` — and
#     `getpwuid` always succeeds, so the `$HOME` branch is unreachable. With
#     `HOME` pointed at a scratch dir, `NSHomeDirectory()`,
#     `FileManager.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser`, `URL.homeDirectory`,
#     `expandingTildeInPath` and `NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains` all still
#     returned the developer's real home.
#   - `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` DOES fence Foundation, verified for a plain unsigned
#     SPM binary: every one of the above returned the scratch path. CF does not
#     cache it, so a runtime `setenv` takes effect on the next call.
#   - So `HOME` fences *subprocesses* — `git`, `tmux`, shells; they do not link
#     CoreFoundation — and `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` fences *in-process Foundation*.
#     Both are needed.
#
# Two things it deliberately does NOT fence, so don't read it as total:
#
#   - **`UserDefaults`.** `cfprefsd` resolves preference paths over XPC, so it
#     ignores `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` entirely. The existing
#     `AppState(userDefaults: UserDefaults(suiteName:))` discipline in
#     `CLAUDE.md` stays load-bearing.
#   - **The Keychain.** It breaks rather than redirects under
#     `CFFIXED_USER_HOME`: `SecItemAdd` returns `-60006` and
#     `SecItemCopyMatching` returns `-25300`, and pre-seeding
#     `$FAKE_HOME/Library/Keychains` does not help. Keychain-touching code must
#     go through an injection seam in tests (`ClaudeCredentialsKeychainDeleting`
#     is the existing one) — under this wrapper a test that reaches the real
#     `Security` framework will fail, by design.
#
# WHY THE TRIPWIRE SUPERSEDES THE FINGERPRINT. The fingerprint compares two
# directory listings, so it can only see a leak that changes the set of names.
# `createDirectory(withIntermediateDirectories: true)` on an *already existing*
# directory returns success without issuing a write syscall — so a leak that
# writes to a FIXED path is caught at most once, ever, and is silent on every
# run afterwards. (Leaks that mint a fresh name per run — the profile-dir leak
# minted a new UUID each time — are the ones it does catch, which is why that
# one eventually became visible.) The tripwire has no such blind spot: it fails
# on the permission check at the call site, not on a state diff, so it fires
# every run and names the culprit. Corollary for anyone testing a guard: **start
# from a clean state.** A leftover directory from an earlier unfenced run makes
# a correctly-working fence look bypassed, because the re-create silently
# succeeds. That misdiagnosis has already happened once.
#
# WHY DETECTION IS CI-ONLY, AND WHY THE DEFAULT SAYS SO. It is trustworthy only
# where nothing else writes to those directories, and that means a CI runner: no
# live daemon, no real worktrees, no sibling checkouts. The fingerprint brackets
# a build plus a full suite — minutes, on a developer box where a running daemon
# legitimately creates `worktrees/<slot>/<name>`, `scratch/`, `notes/` and
# `channels/` entries, any sibling worktree running `scripts/restart.sh` drops a
# top-level `state.db.pre-migration.<ts>`, Claude Code writes into `~/.claude`
# throughout, and any concurrent session starting an agent in a new directory
# mints a fresh `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-hash>`. Those are real writes by real
# software, not leaks, and a guard that reddens on them gets switched off inside
# a week.
#
# So the DEFAULT follows the argument instead of contradicting it: detection is
# on when `$CI` is set and off otherwise. It is not "on unless the one caller
# who knows better opts out" — a developer running this wrapper directly used to
# inherit a guard written for a machine they are not on. `--fingerprint` turns it
# on locally for a deliberate leak hunt (do it on an otherwise-quiet box);
# `--no-fingerprint` forces it off anywhere, including CI. The fence is the layer
# that actually *stops* leaks, and it is never optional.
#
# All eight FENCE vars are OVERWRITTEN, not defaulted: an inherited value is
# discarded for the duration of the run. That is the point — a fence you can
# disable by exporting something first is not a fence — but it does mean this
# wrapper cannot be pointed at a config dir of your own.
#
# `TBD_SWIFT_LOCK_PATH`, the ninth, is the deliberate exception: it is
# admission control rather than isolation, an inherited value names a lock the
# caller wants this run to contend on, and honouring it can only ever make the
# run wait for more things. Nothing about the fence weakens if it is respected.
#
# They are applied as a prefix on the `swift test` invocation rather than
# exported, so this script's own `$HOME` and `$TMUX_TMPDIR` stay real and
# `scripts/tbd-home-fingerprint.sh` — which deliberately reads both — needs
# no special-casing on either side of the run. The shared-lock computation below
# depends on the same property: it reads the real `$HOME` / `$TBD_HOME`, which
# only works because nothing here has exported the fenced values.
#
# `--fingerprint` / `--no-fingerprint` are consumed wherever they appear; every
# other argument is forwarded to `swift test` untouched. Position-independent on
# purpose: a leading-only strip forwards a late `--no-fingerprint` to `swift
# test`, which errors out. That is loud rather than silent, but a positional
# collision is impossible — `swift test` has no flag of either name — so
# filtering them out everywhere is strictly safer at no cost. Last one wins.

#
# THE REMOTE VERIFICATION VALVE — OFF UNLESS `TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY=1`.
# (docs/specs/2026-08-16-remote-verification-valve-design.md.) This wrapper is
# the only caller that opts in, because it is the one whose entire output is a
# verdict: nothing it produces has to exist on this disk, so the same bit can be
# computed on GitHub. `scripts/restart.sh` and every other artifact build stay
# local permanently and are untouched by any of this.
#
# Enabled, the run bounds its queueing: `TBD_SWIFT_QUEUE_YIELD_SECONDS` tells
# `scripts/swift-safe` to give up its place in the queue after
# `TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY_YIELD_SECONDS` (default 300) and answer 76. The threshold
# measures QUEUE time, never run time, so a yield discards nothing — a wait that
# never acquired the slot has compiled nothing. 300 is sized against remote
# capacity rather than impatience: two hours of sampled contention put T=60 at
# ~28 trips an hour against a remote that sustains ~12 runs an hour, while T=300
# fires four or five times, on the tail this valve exists for.
#
# OFF, THE BOUND IS CLEARED RATHER THAN LEFT ALONE, and that is what makes
# "off" mean the pre-valve behavior exactly. `TBD_SWIFT_QUEUE_YIELD_SECONDS` is
# a knob `swift-safe` documents and honours on any `test` run, whether or not
# this valve is enabled — so a caller who exported it would otherwise yield 76
# with the valve off, down a path that does not route, and this wrapper would
# exit 76 having tested nothing.
#
# THREE EXIT CODES DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, AND CONFLATING ANY TWO IS A SILENT
# WRONG ANSWER:
#
#   76 from `swift-safe` — it yielded the queue at our request. Verify remotely.
#   75 from `swift-safe` — the wait TIMED OUT, or was ABANDONED because nobody
#      is left to read the result. Neither is a request to verify elsewhere, so
#      75 is propagated untouched; dispatching one spends a scarce remote slot
#      on a verdict nobody wants.
#   78 from `remote-verify.sh` — a precondition refused (dirty tree, no `gh`,
#      no pushable ref). The run falls back to the local queue. THE VALVE IS AN
#      OPTIMISATION, NEVER A GATE: a refusal must never fail a run.
#
# `remote-verify.sh` answers 0 for a green remote run and 1 for a red one whose
# failing tests it has already printed. THOSE TWO, AND ONLY THOSE TWO, ARE
# VERDICTS. Everything else it can produce — 127 for a mangled interpreter line,
# 130 for a Ctrl-C, 2 for a syntax error in it — says nothing about the tests,
# and adopting one would report a suite that never ran as a failing suite. Any
# status outside `{0, 1, 78}` is therefore treated exactly as 78 is, with the
# status named on the way past.
#
# A NARROWED RUN ROUTES, BUT ITS VERDICT IS READ DIFFERENTLY — AND THE
# ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM. This wrapper forwards `--filter` and friends
# to `swift test`, and the dispatch has no way to carry them, so a remote run is
# always the WHOLE suite. The two outcomes are not equally transferable:
#
#   GREEN whole-suite IS sound for a narrowed caller. If every test passed, then
#      every subset of them passed, whatever the caller selected. It is adopted,
#      with one line saying the run was the whole suite so nobody reads its test
#      count as their subset's.
#   RED whole-suite IS NOT. The failures may lie entirely outside what the
#      caller selected, and reporting them as this run's result would name tests
#      it deliberately excluded. The narrowed suite is re-run locally instead and
#      the LOCAL verdict is reported.
#
# A LISTING RUN IS THE ONE THING THAT DOES NOT ROUTE, and it is not an exception
# to the asymmetry so much as a different question. `--list-tests`, and the bare
# `list` subcommand that spells the same thing, ask for OUTPUT — the test names —
# and a verdict is not output. Green would exit 0 having printed nothing the
# caller asked for; red would report failures for a run that was never going to
# run a test. So the valve is left DISARMED for those invocations rather than
# armed and then interpreted; see `asks_for_a_listing` below.
#
# WHY NOT JUST REFUSE TO ROUTE A NARROWED RUN, which would need no interpretation
# at all: because it turns the valve off for every real caller. `pre-push`
# narrows both of its passes, the nightly stress harness forwards a filter, and
# four of five live queued test lanes were `--filter` runs. Interpreting the
# verdict keeps all of them eligible, and costs a local re-run only on red — the
# case that was going to run locally anyway.
#
# ONE CONSEQUENCE WORTH KNOWING, because it is a real loss and not a wash.
# `pre-push` gives each pass a test-count floor, and a floor is a minimum, so a
# whole-suite count clears a narrowed pass's floor for free — including the
# tier-3 pass whose floor of 35 exists to catch `--filter` matching nothing. A
# renamed live-suite type slips past that pass whenever its verdict came from a
# green whole-suite remote run. The floors still catch a collapse; they stop
# catching a vacuous filter. The follow-up below is what fixes it properly.
#
# THE COUNT MUST DESCRIBE THE RUN BEING REPORTED, and on the narrowed-red path
# that is the LOCAL re-run rather than the remote suite. Those consumers take
# the FIRST count in the log, so a remote count printed on the way past would
# answer for a verdict nobody adopted — see the `--narrowed` handoff at the
# dispatch below, which is what keeps it out of the log.
#
# TESTED BY `scripts/test.test.sh`, which drives the guards below against

# THE HOLDER SWEEP, AND WHY `rm -rf` IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN.
#
# A `TBDHolder` is built to outlive the thing that spawned it: it calls
# `setsid()` and ignores `SIGHUP` on purpose (`Sources/TBDHolder/Holder.swift`),
# so the death of the test process that spawned it ends neither the holder nor
# the job it supervises. It re-parents to launchd and keeps running. Nothing in
# the product reclaims one of these: `OrphanGC`'s rowless-holder collector
# enumerates the REAL `~/tbd/holders`, a fixture's socket is under this scratch
# root instead, and `AgentReaper`'s holder leg works from `terminal` rows that a
# fixture's in-memory database never had. One measured instance ran for 24 hours
# with its job still looping.
#
# BY RESOURCE, NEVER BY PATTERN. This machine runs other people's agents and
# live production holders, so `pkill -f TBDHolder` would kill somebody's real
# session. The socket path is unique to this run and lives inside a directory
# this run created, so the only processes that can hold it open are this run's
# own — which makes "who has this exact file open" the safe discriminator and
# the name of the binary an unsafe one.
#
# `-a` IS LOAD-BEARING. lsof ORs its selection options by default, so
# `lsof -t -U <path>` means "every unix-socket holder on the machine, OR this
# path" and answers with hundreds of pids — every process with any unix socket
# open, which on this box is most of them. `-a` ANDs them instead. Getting this
# wrong does not fail loudly; it kills the machine.
#
# CHILDREN ARE ENUMERATED BEFORE THE PARENT DIES, because a holder's job
# re-parents to launchd the moment the holder is gone and no `pgrep -P` can
# reach it afterwards.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER, so the layering is not mistaken for a
# hole. A socket is the only safe handle on a holder, so a holder whose socket
# is ALREADY GONE is invisible here — and a fixture teardown that ran and missed
# removes its scratch root, socket included, before this ever looks. That case
# belongs to the fixture, which remembers the pids it spawned and sweeps them
# identity-checked (`HibernationFixture.sweepRememberedProcesses`); this sweep
# owns the case where no teardown ran at all, which is the one where the socket
# is still there. The alternative — matching the holder's argv or its name —
# is what must never be done: this machine runs live production holders and
# other people's agents, and no pattern can tell them from ours.

# THE RECONCILER FOR THE RUN THAT COULD NOT CLEAN UP AFTER ITSELF.
#
# `trap cleanup EXIT` covers a normal exit and a TERMed wrapper alike — bash
# runs an EXIT trap on a fatal signal too. What no in-process teardown can cover
# is a SIGKILLed wrapper, a panicked kernel or a machine that lost power
# mid-run: the trap never runs, the scratch root survives, and any holder inside
# it keeps running with nobody left who remembers it.
#
# So the reclaim for that case is somebody ELSE's run, at start-up, over the
# siblings this directory has accumulated. It is the named reconciler for
# fixture holders in the doctrine's sense
# (`docs/specs/2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md`): a background
# pass that enumerates ground truth — the run roots actually on disk — compares
# it against intent, and reclaims the difference. Every run is a sweep, so the
# machine self-heals as soon as anyone tests again, and there is no timer, no
# daemon and no scheduler.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR IS TWO-PART, AND THE SECOND HALF IS WHY THIS CAN KILL AT
# ALL. Age says nobody is coming back — no run lasts a day. `run_root_is_live`
# says whether anybody is still there, from a claim the owning run writes into
# its own root. Age alone would be a proxy, and the one case it reads wrong is
# the expensive one: a WEDGED run stops writing, so its root ages exactly like
# an abandoned one while everything inside it is still in use. Both must agree
# before anything is signalled.
#
# ORDER MATTERS: the processes go first and the files second, for the same
# reason the tmux sweep runs before its `rm -rf`. Removing a socket out from
# under a live holder leaves the holder running with nothing able to reach it.
#
# `-user` and `-type d` keep it to directories this uid owns — `/tmp` is mode
# 1777, so anybody can create a name that matches — and a symlink is `-type l`,
# so a planted one is never followed and never removed.
#
# `-H` IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE, AND ITS ABSENCE FAILS SILENTLY. On darwin `/tmp` is
# itself a symlink to `/private/tmp`, and find will not descend into a symlinked
# starting point unless told to: without `-H` this enumerates exactly nothing,
# exits 0, and reclaims nothing, forever. `-H` follows only the paths named on

# THE ARGUMENTS THAT REDUCE THE SUITE. This does not decide WHETHER to route —
# a narrowed run routes like any other — it decides how the answer is read. A
# routed run is always the whole suite, and only its GREEN answer transfers to a
# caller who asked for less (whole suite passed ⟹ every subset passed). Its red
# answer does not, so a narrowed caller re-runs locally to attribute it. See
# "A NARROWED RUN ROUTES" above.
#
# FOLLOW-UP: pass the caller's narrowing arguments to the dispatch, so a narrowed
# run gets a narrowed remote verdict and there is nothing left to interpret. That
# input is attacker-adjacent text — a filter is a regex that may legally contain
# `$`, backticks and `;` — so it must be ALLOWLISTED against these same names and
# handed to the workflow through `env:`, never interpolated into a `run:` body.
# `.github/workflows/preflight-cleanup.yml` already does exactly that with a
# branch name, and the comment there says why.
#
# The list is deliberately allowed to be over-broad, and the new reading makes
# that cheaper than it was. A false positive now costs one local re-run, and only
# on a red remote verdict — the case that was going to run locally anyway. A
# false negative adopts a whole-suite failure as a narrowed run's result, naming
# tests the caller excluded. So anything that plausibly reduces what runs belongs
# here.
#
# THE ENTRIES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS ON THE LIST. Read out of this toolchain's own
# `swift-test` binary rather than remembered, because a name that does not exist
# costs nothing and a name that does and is missing is the expensive direction:
#
#   --filter / --skip           select and deselect test cases by regex.
#   --specifier / -s            the deprecated spelling of `--filter` (the
#                               binary still carries `'--specifier' option is
#                               deprecated; use '--filter' instead`), so a
#                               caller using it narrows exactly as much.
#   --disable-xctest            drops a whole testing library's cases.
#   --disable-swift-testing
#   --test-product              restricts the run to ONE test product, which on
#                               a multi-product package is the largest reduction
#                               available. The binary names it itself: "found
#                               multiple test products: …; use --test-product to
#                               select one".
#   --list-tests                DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT THE MECHANISM. A listing
#                               invocation never routes at all — the valve is
#                               left disarmed for it by `asks_for_a_listing`
#                               below, because a whole-suite verdict answers a
#                               listing question in neither direction. It stays
#                               on this list so that were that gate ever
#                               bypassed, a red whole-suite verdict still would
#                               not be adopted as a listing run's result.
#   list                        `swift test list` is the same thing as a
#                               subcommand. It is a bare word rather than a
#                               flag, so it matches a `--filter list` value too;
#                               a false positive there now costs the run only
#                               the valve, which is still the cheap direction.

# `/tmp/tbd-test-home.XXXXXXXX/sanctioned/tbd/sock` is ~47 bytes and cannot.
#
# TBD_SOCKET_PATH is set anyway — it is the sanctioned escape hatch for that

# of this scratch dir to a deeper path cannot silently reintroduce the
# overflow. It is set to exactly the value TBD_HOME would derive, so
# `ConstantsTests.ProductionVarSmokeSuite.socketPathSuffix` — which asserts a
# `/sock` suffix — still holds under this wrapper.
#
# TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME is the third leg and is easy to forget, because fencing
# `TBD_HOME` alone looks complete: a default-constructed
# `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager` then gets a scratch `baseDirectory` and the
# developer's REAL `~/.claude` as its `hostBaseDirectory`, which
# `ensureMirrorSlot` creates directories in, moves whole subtrees within, and
# writes symlinks into.
#
# TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME is the fourth, and it is the same omission one store over:
# `CodexHomeManager` falls back to `~/.codex` and `ensureProfilePlugin()`
# creates directories and writes a plugin manifest, hooks and a profile TOML
# there. It was previously left to individual tests to remember, which is
# exactly the shape the run-wide fence exists to replace.
#
# TMUX_TMPDIR is the fifth, and the store it fences is not a TBD one at all:
# `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`, shared by every tmux server this user runs. Nothing in
# `Sources/` or `Tests/` ever passes an absolute `-S <path>`; every call site
# uses `-L <name>`, which tmux resolves under `$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>/`, so
# this one variable redirects all of them.
#
# WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS: **tmux never unlinks its socket file on
# server exit** — measured against tmux 3.6a, and true for a killed server, a
# cleanly `kill-server`ed one and one that self-exits when its last session
# ends alike. It unlinks a stale socket lazily instead, at bind time, when a
# NEW server is started on that exact path. Every test here mints a fresh
# UUID-suffixed socket name, so that lazy unlink never fires and every file
# survives forever: ~7,100 dead socket files accumulated in one developer's
# real `/tmp/tmux-<uid>` over nine days, behind 7 live servers. No teardown
# can fix that — a test that dutifully kills its server still leaves the file
# — which is why the fix is a fenced directory that gets deleted wholesale,
# not a missing `kill-server` somewhere.
#
# IT MUST STAY DIRECTLY UNDER THE SHORT `/tmp` SCRATCH ROOT. tmux connects
# over a unix socket, so `$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>/<name>` is bound by the same
# ~104-byte `sun_path` cap as TBD's own socket, and tmux reports an overflow
# only as `error connecting to <path> (File name too long)`. The budget:
# `/tmp/tbd-test-home.XXXXXXXX/tmux/tmux-<uid>/` is ~42 bytes, and the suite's
# longest socket name is ~31 bytes today (`tbd-test-send-mismatch-` plus 8 hex
# characters) with 50 budgeted as headroom — ~92 bytes against ~104. Nesting
# this directory any deeper spends that headroom and every live tmux test
# starts failing at once. `scripts/test.test.sh` asserts the budget so a
# refactor that moves it cannot land quietly.

# measured here, the scratch dir is gone either way. No INT/TERM handler needed.
#
# The other half of that interaction lives in the harness: it kills the process
# tree LEAVES FIRST, so `swift test` is already dead before bash gets round to
# this `rm -rf`. A parent-first kill would have this deleting a `TBD_HOME` an
# orphaned test run was still writing into.

# THE TWO ROOTS HAVE DIFFERENT LIFETIMES, ON PURPOSE.
#
# The sanctioned root is the one above: fresh per run and deleted on exit.
# Reusing it would let one run's `state.db`, sockets and profile dirs be visible
# to the next, which is exactly the cross-run contamination the fence exists to
# prevent.
#
# The fake home is stable and deliberately NOT deleted, because setting
# `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` also relocates SwiftPM's own caches (`~/.swiftpm`,
# `~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm`) into it. A fresh fake home each run
# re-pays the manifest-cache miss every time: measured on this package,
# `swift package describe` went 0.191s unfenced to 0.553s fenced-and-cold. It
# holds only caches and the decoys — no test state — so persisting it
# contaminates nothing. (The module cache lives in `.build/` and is unaffected
# either way.)
#
# IT LIVES UNDER `$TMPDIR`, NOT `/tmp`. On darwin `$TMPDIR` is a per-user
# `/var/folders/...` directory, mode 700 and owned by the calling uid, so nobody
# else can pre-create anything inside it. `/tmp` is mode 1777: any local user —
# or any process running as this one — can plant `tbd-test-fakehome.<uid>` as a
# SYMLINK first, and `mkdir -p` on a symlink-to-a-directory succeeds silently
# while `chmod` resolves straight through it. Pointed at `$HOME`, that made this
# very loop `chmod 000` the developer's real `~/tbd` and `~/.claude` — reproduced
# — leaving a daemon that cannot open `state.db` and nothing pointing back here.
# The `/tmp` fallback below exists only for a stripped environment with no
# `TMPDIR`, and the ownership checks are what make it safe.
#
# The `sun_path` argument that pins the SANCTIONED root to `/tmp` does not apply
# here: it is about the socket, which lives under the sanctioned root, and
# `TBD_SOCKET_PATH` pins it there explicitly.

# writes into the developer's real `~/tbd`. There is exactly one prefix, so
# there is nothing to keep in step.

# EXIT trap above deletes. A few fixtures — the holder ones — cannot live inside
# `TBD_HOME` and need a short root of their own, because they bind a rendezvous
# socket at `<root>/holders/<36-char uuid>.sock` against a ~104-byte `sun_path`:
# under `TBD_HOME` that is `/tmp/tbd-test-home.XXXXXXXX/sanctioned/tbd/<prefix>-
# xxxxxxxx/holders/<uuid>.sock` — 106 to 108 bytes across the four prefixes in
# use, 106 for `tbdh`, 107 for `tbdh6` and `tbdh7`, 108 for `tbdg10` — and the
# bind fails for every one of them; directly under the run root the same path is
# 91 to 93, with headroom to spare. Before this variable existed
# they minted `/tmp/<prefix>-xxxxxxxx` instead — outside the fence entirely, so
# a run killed mid-flight (no in-process teardown can run then) left the
# directory behind forever. Nesting under the root the trap deletes makes that
# reclaim kill-proof, at the cost of one more name the fixtures have to be told.
