# Governed-build helpers for restart.sh. Safe to source: defines functions
# only, launches nothing, installs nothing.
#
# restart.sh's job after the build is destructive and machine-wide — it
# assembles a bundle, copies it over /Applications/TBD.app, and restarts the
# shared daemon. Everything it ships comes out of .build/<config>, so it may only
# run when the build it just asked for actually produced those binaries. That
# makes "did the build succeed?" a load-bearing decision rather than a
# formality, which is why it lives here as a pure function with its own
# harness (scripts/restart-build-lib.test.sh).
#
# Exit statuses come from scripts/swift-safe; its EXIT_MEANINGS dict is the
# authoritative list. Two of them mean the machine-wide build lock was never
# obtained, so *nothing was compiled* — those are retryable, and reporting
# them as a compile failure would send a reader hunting for a compiler error
# that does not exist.

# Statuses that mean scripts/swift-safe never got the shared build slot: 75
# (EX_TEMPFAIL — the wait timed out or the requester went away) and 76 (the
# wait yielded its place in the queue). Both compiled nothing at all.

# May restart.sh ship what is in .build/<config>, given the status of the build
# it just ran? Only a clean zero says yes. Deliberately not "is it one of the
# statuses I recognize" — an unrecognized non-zero is still a build that did
# not finish, and a whitelist of known-good is the only shape that stays safe
# when scripts/swift-safe grows a status this file has never heard of.

# Run the governed build for the worktree at $1, passing the remaining
# arguments through to `scripts/swift-safe build`. Prints the last few lines
# of the build output and returns scripts/swift-safe's real exit status.
#
# The build output goes to a temp file rather than through `| tail -3`
# because the pipeline is exactly the bug this function exists to prevent:
# a pipeline's exit status is the LAST command's, so `swift-safe … | tail -3`
# always reports 0, `set -e` never fires, and restart.sh happily ships
# whatever stale binaries were already in .build/<config>. That is not
# hypothetical — a 1800s lock timeout (exit 75, nothing compiled) was read as
# a successful build and the app and daemon were relaunched machine-wide.
# scripts/swift-safe prints its numeric status on a final stderr line
# precisely so it survives a pipe; capture the real status anyway and do not
# "simplify" this back into a pipeline.
#
# The trimming itself is deliberate and must stay: full compiler output is
# thousands of lines and restart.sh is nearly always run by an agent, whose
# context window it would otherwise flood. swift-safe's final "exit status N"
# line is the last thing it writes, so the tail keeps it.
