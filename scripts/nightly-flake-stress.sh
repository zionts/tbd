# scripts/nightly-flake-stress.sh — run the historically flaky suites repeatedly
# under induced CPU load. Step 2 of the nightly workflow
# (docs/specs/2026-07-24-test-hardening-design.md §9).
#
# Each target is attached to an OPEN issue that names the flake. A failure here
# lands as a comment on that issue, so the evidence accumulates where the
# diagnosis lives instead of in a log nobody reads.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU, stated here because the report repeats it and the
# tracking issue repeats it again: CI is ~4 cores on an otherwise idle runner.
# #503's reproduction regime is loadavg ~150 on a 12-core box shared by four
# agents. A zero-failure night is NOT evidence that any of these flakes is
# fixed — it is one sample from a much gentler regime. The word "fixed" does not
# appear in this script's output by design; the numbers it reports are
# iterations, observed loadavg, and core count, so a reader can judge the regime
# for themselves.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/nightly-flake-stress.sh [--iterations N] [--spinners K]
#                                   [--target NAME] [--report-dir DIR] [--no-load]
#
# Exit: 0 = every target clean, 1 = at least one target FAILED, 2 = harness error.
#
# KILL DISCIPLINE (Tests/CLAUDE.md "The kill hazards" — every line paid for):
#   - spinner PIDs are CAPTURED AT SPAWN into an array; cleanup kills those only
#   - never `jobs -p` (job control is off in a non-interactive shell)
#   - never `trap 'kill 0'` (signals this shell's own process group)
#   - never `pkill -f <pattern>` (matches sibling worktrees' identical bundles)
#   - the deadline kills the iteration's whole process TREE, leaves first, by
#     walking `pgrep -P` from the captured pid — one level would orphan the
#     grandchild swift-frontend / test bundle under scripts/test.sh
#   - post-cleanup verification is `ps -p <captured pid>`, never `pgrep -x yes`
#   - trap on INT/TERM as well as EXIT, so an externally killed run still cleans up

# target|swift-test-filter-args|floor|issue|description
#
# Floors are MEASURED, never guessed. `swift test --filter` exits GREEN when it
# matches nothing, and the filter matches the TYPE name rather than the @Suite
# display string — so a renamed suite silently runs zero tests and passes. A
# floor copied from a grep of `@Test` is a floor that has never been checked
# against the runner.
#
# Measured 2026-07-27 on this tree (swift 6.3.3, unloaded):
#   ControlModeInputHealth  10 tests      GitManagerTimeout  6 tests
#   AppearanceDebounce       7 tests      whole fast pass    4308 tests
#
# The floors sit BELOW those, following test.yml's precedent: they exist to fire
# when a pass collapses to near-nothing, not to break every time somebody adds or
# deletes a test. A floor pinned to the exact count would make ordinary test
# churn look like a filter defect.
