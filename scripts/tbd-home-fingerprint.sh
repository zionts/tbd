# Prints a stable fingerprint of the REAL `~/tbd`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`,
# `~/Library/Logs/TBD/hang-stacks` and the tmux socket directory — deliberately
# `$HOME/...` and the CALLER's `$TMUX_TMPDIR`, never
# `$TBD_HOME` / `$TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME` /
# `$TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME` or the fenced socket dir, because the whole point is
# to observe the directories a test run is supposed to leave alone even while
# those overrides point somewhere else.
#
# Bracket a test run with two calls and diff them: any added or removed entry
# means something wrote into a real store the run should not have touched, which
# `CLAUDE.md` ("Tests must not touch ~/tbd") forbids. Once cost 18k orphan
# profile dirs and ~2.9k fake worktrees before anyone noticed.
#
# Only `scripts/test.sh` — and only when its detection layer is enabled — should
# be diffing these. See that script's header for why detection is CI-only.
#
# Depth 3 covers the whole tree, not just `profiles/`:
#   depth 1  a brand-new top-level directory nobody has thought of yet
#   depth 2  profiles/<id>, repos/<id>, scratch/<id>, worktrees/<slot>
#   depth 3  worktrees/<slot>/<name> — the shape the worktree leak took, and
#            invisible at depth 2 because the slot dir already existed
# It stops there on purpose: descending into a worktree means walking a full
# checkout, and a leak always announces itself at the root of one.
#
# NAMES ONLY — never sizes, never mtimes. `state.db`, `state.db-wal` and
# `state.db-shm` change size continuously while a daemon is live, so a
# size- or mtime-based fingerprint would go red on every run and be switched
# off inside a week. Their *names* are stable, which is what makes including
# them free: a migration run against the real `~/tbd` drops a brand-new
# `state.db.pre-migration.<timestamp>` next to them (63 such files, 1.0 GB,
# have accumulated on one box), and a new name is exactly what this catches.

# ~/.claude — one directory over, and reachable by the same class of leak. A
# default-constructed `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager` mirrors slots FROM this
# store into each profile dir, and `ensureMirrorSlot` creates directories in it,
# MOVES whole subtrees within it, and writes symlinks into it. Fencing only
# `TBD_HOME` looks complete and leaves this wide open, so the detector covers
# both or the same leak one directory over stays invisible.
#
# TWO arms, and the second is the one that catches the leak this code can
# actually produce.
#
#   `~/.claude` at depth 1 — the top-level shape. A leak cannot invent a name
#   here: `ensureMirrorSlot` opens with `guard fm.fileExists(atPath:
#   hostEntry.path) else { return }`, so every host-side write requires the
#   depth-1 slot to exist already. What this arm catches is a run that creates
#   `~/.claude` itself, or one that deletes/renames a slot out from under the
#   user — not a new slot appearing.
#
#   `~/.claude/projects` at depth 1 — the `<cwd-hash>` entries. THIS is where
#   the mutation lands: `mergeRecursive(src: cwdHashPath, dst: hostCwdHashPath)`
#   moves a profile's whole `projects/<cwd-hash>/` subtree into the host store,
#   which is depth 2 overall and invisible to the arm above.
#
# It stops there. Claude Code writes `projects/<slug>/*.jsonl` continuously
# while any session is live, so a deeper walk would report the machine rather
# than the run and get switched off within a week. A new `<cwd-hash>` directory
# is rare enough on a runner to be signal — which is also why detection is
# CI-only (see `scripts/test.sh`).
#
# On a CI runner `~/.claude` typically does not exist at all, so both arms read
# `<absent>` on either side. That is thinner coverage than on a populated box,
# not zero: a run that CREATES either directory flips `<absent>` to a listing
# and goes red. Stated plainly rather than dressed up.

#   than the run: Codex rewrites `.tmp/`, `shell_snapshots/`, `sessions/` and
#   several multi-hundred-MB sqlite sidecars continuously while any Codex
#   session is live.
#
#   `~/.codex/plugins/cache` at depth 1 — the `<marketplace>` entries, where
#   `CodexPluginWriter.writePlugin` lands (`plugins/cache/tbd/tbd/local/...`).
#   That is depth 3 overall and invisible to the arm above on any box that

# The tmux socket directory — the fourth root, and the only one that lives
# outside `$HOME` entirely. It is flat, so depth 1 sees everything: one socket
# file per server, named after the `-L <name>` it was started with.
#
# WHAT IT CATCHES. A run that starts a tmux server with `TMUX_TMPDIR` dropped
# from its environment leaves a socket file here — and leaves it FOREVER, because
# tmux does not unlink its socket when the server exits; it unlinks a stale one
# lazily at bind time, when a new server claims that exact path. Since every
# test mints a fresh UUID-suffixed name, nothing ever reclaims one. ~7,100 dead
# files accumulated in one real socket directory over nine days that way, behind
# 7 live servers. A new name here is therefore permanent litter, which is exactly
# the shape this detector is good at seeing.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, and why detection stays CI-only. On a developer box a live
# daemon and every live TBD session legitimately create `tbd-<hex>` sockets here
# throughout a run, so this arm reports the machine rather than the run and would
# be switched off within a week. On a runner nothing else creates them, and any
# entry appearing between the two snapshots came from the suite. It also cannot
# attribute: it names the socket, not the code that opened it — that is what
# `TMUX_TMPDIR` in the fence is for, since a fenced run cannot produce the entry
# at all.

# ~/Library/Logs/TBD/hang-stacks — the fifth root, and the only one a sweep
# DELETES from. `HangStackCollector` (`OrphanGC`'s hang-stack phase) reclaims
# files here, and `HangStackWriter` creates them, so this directory is reachable
# in both directions: a test that escapes the fence can leave a hang stack
# behind, and one that escapes it while the reclaimer runs can destroy a
# developer's real diagnostics. It is the first GC target outside `~/tbd`, which
# is precisely why it needs an arm of its own — none of the four above covers a
# path under `~/Library`.
#
# Depth 1, and NAMES ONLY, like every arm here. The directory is flat by
# construction — one file per hang event, `hang-<timestamp>-<pid>.txt`, appended
# to in place — so depth 1 sees the whole thing, and a name is what changes when
# a file is created or reclaimed. Contents grow continuously while a hang is in
# progress, which is exactly the churn a size- or mtime-based fingerprint would
# report as a leak.
#
# Like the tmux arm, this one reports the MACHINE rather than the run on a
# developer box: a real app hang during a local `--fingerprint` run writes a
# file here legitimately. That is another reason detection stays CI-only, where
# no TBDApp is running.
#
# On a CI runner the directory typically does not exist at all, so both
# snapshots read `<absent>` — thinner coverage than on a populated box, not
# zero: a run that CREATES it flips `<absent>` to a listing and goes red.
