# Prints a stable fingerprint of the REAL `~/tbd`, `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` —
# deliberately `$HOME/...`, never `$TBD_HOME` / `$TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME` /
# `$TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME`, because the whole point is to observe the directories
# a test run is supposed to leave alone even while those overrides point
# somewhere else.
#
# Bracket a test run with two calls and diff them: any added or removed entry
# means something wrote into a real store the run should not have touched, which
# `CLAUDE.md` ("Tests must not touch ~/tbd") forbids. Once cost 18k orphan
# profile dirs and ~2.9k fake worktrees before anyone noticed.
#
# Only `scripts/test.sh` — and only when its detection layer is enabled — should
# be diffing these. See that script's header for why detection is CI-only.
#
# Depth 3 covers the whole tree, not just `profiles/`:
#   depth 1  a brand-new top-level directory nobody has thought of yet
#   depth 2  profiles/<id>, repos/<id>, scratch/<id>, worktrees/<slot>
#   depth 3  worktrees/<slot>/<name> — the shape the worktree leak took, and
#            invisible at depth 2 because the slot dir already existed
# It stops there on purpose: descending into a worktree means walking a full
# checkout, and a leak always announces itself at the root of one.
#
# NAMES ONLY — never sizes, never mtimes. `state.db`, `state.db-wal` and
# `state.db-shm` change size continuously while a daemon is live, so a
# size- or mtime-based fingerprint would go red on every run and be switched
# off inside a week. Their *names* are stable, which is what makes including
# them free: a migration run against the real `~/tbd` drops a brand-new
# `state.db.pre-migration.<timestamp>` next to them (63 such files, 1.0 GB,
# have accumulated on one box), and a new name is exactly what this catches.

# ~/.claude — one directory over, and reachable by the same class of leak. A
# default-constructed `ClaudeProfileConfigDirManager` mirrors slots FROM this
# store into each profile dir, and `ensureMirrorSlot` creates directories in it,
# MOVES whole subtrees within it, and writes symlinks into it. Fencing only
# `TBD_HOME` looks complete and leaves this wide open, so the detector covers
# both or the same leak one directory over stays invisible.
#
# TWO arms, and the second is the one that catches the leak this code can
# actually produce.
#
#   `~/.claude` at depth 1 — the top-level shape. A leak cannot invent a name
#   here: `ensureMirrorSlot` opens with `guard fm.fileExists(atPath:
#   hostEntry.path) else { return }`, so every host-side write requires the
#   depth-1 slot to exist already. What this arm catches is a run that creates
#   `~/.claude` itself, or one that deletes/renames a slot out from under the
#   user — not a new slot appearing.
#
#   `~/.claude/projects` at depth 1 — the `<cwd-hash>` entries. THIS is where
#   the mutation lands: `mergeRecursive(src: cwdHashPath, dst: hostCwdHashPath)`
#   moves a profile's whole `projects/<cwd-hash>/` subtree into the host store,
#   which is depth 2 overall and invisible to the arm above.
#
# It stops there. Claude Code writes `projects/<slug>/*.jsonl` continuously
# while any session is live, so a deeper walk would report the machine rather
# than the run and get switched off within a week. A new `<cwd-hash>` directory
# is rare enough on a runner to be signal — which is also why detection is
# CI-only (see `scripts/test.sh`).
#
# On a CI runner `~/.claude` typically does not exist at all, so both arms read
# `<absent>` on either side. That is thinner coverage than on a populated box,
# not zero: a run that CREATES either directory flips `<absent>` to a listing
# and goes red. Stated plainly rather than dressed up.

# ~/.codex — the third host store, reachable by the same class of leak.

#   creates `~/.codex` itself. A deeper walk would report the machine rather
#   than the run: Codex rewrites `.tmp/`, `shell_snapshots/`, `sessions/` and
#   several multi-hundred-MB sqlite sidecars continuously while any Codex
#   session is live.
#
#   `~/.codex/plugins/cache` at depth 1 — the `<marketplace>` entries, where
#   `CodexPluginWriter.writePlugin` lands (`plugins/cache/tbd/tbd/local/...`).
