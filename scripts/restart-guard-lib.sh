# WIP-guard helpers for restart.sh — pure functions, no side effects, safe to
# source. restart.sh sources this to decide whether a build is "install-ready" (safe
# to install to /Applications + restart the shared daemon); scripts/restart-guard-lib.test.sh
# sources it to unit-test the helpers. All functions read the global REPO_ROOT.
#
# An install-ready build must have:
#  (a) A working tree with no install-affecting changes — NO tracked changes AND
#      no new untracked files within INSTALL_PATHSPECS
#  (b) HEAD as an ancestor of main (upstream/main, origin/main, or main)

# The set of paths that can affect the installed product: swift build compiles
# Sources/ per Package.swift/Package.resolved; the bundle assembly copies
# Resources/TBDApp.Info.plist and Resources/AppIcon.icns into the bundle; and
# restart.sh together with every library it sources determines what lands in
# /Applications. Nothing else (Tests/, docs/, other scripts, stray root files)
# can change the installed product. Adding a library to restart.sh means adding
# it here too — restart-guard-lib.test.sh derives the expected set from
# restart.sh's own `source` lines and fails if one is missing.

===============================================================================
WARNING: NOT INSTALL-READY — WIP WORKTREE GUARD ACTIVE
===============================================================================

This worktree is on a feature branch or has uncommitted/untracked changes. To
prevent accidental takeover of the shared daemon and /Applications/TBD.app, the
full install is SKIPPED. Instead, the app will build and launch from this
worktree's own .build/${build_config:-debug}/TBD.app.

CONSEQUENCES:
  • Deep links (tbd://) will NOT route to this app (they'll route to the
    currently-installed build in /Applications)
  • The daemon continues running the previous worktree's build
  • Dev loop works normally (build, code, reload)

DETAILS:
EOF
    printf '  Branch: %s\n' "$current_branch" >&2
    if [ "$dirty_count" -gt 0 ]; then
        printf '  Dirty/untracked files: %s\n' "$dirty_count" >&2
    fi
    printf '  Currently installed from: %s\n' "$installed_path" >&2

    cat >&2 << 'EOF'

TO OVERRIDE (force full install):
  scripts/restart.sh --wip
  or
  TBD_INSTALL_WIP=1 scripts/restart.sh

TO FIX (make it install-ready):
  • Commit your changes: git add -A && git commit -m "..."
  • Rebase onto upstream/main: git rebase upstream/main
  • Or push to a tracking branch
