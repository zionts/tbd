#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Tests for scripts/test.sh — run: bash scripts/test.test.sh
#
# MACOS ONLY, AND LOUDLY SO. `mode_of` reads the file mode with BSD `stat -f`,
# which GNU `stat` spells differently, so on Linux the mode comes back empty and
# the decoy cases fail rather than passing vacuously. That is why this file runs
# in the macOS `lint` job while the other script harnesses run on `ubuntu-latest`
# (.github/workflows/test.yml).
#
# AND IT MUST BE VERIFIED WITH `/bin/bash`, WHICH ON MACOS IS 3.2. A developer
# with Homebrew's bash first on `PATH` is running 5.x, where several constructs
# 3.2 cannot parse work fine — a `case` with an empty-string pattern nested
# inside `"$( )"` inside another quoted string is the one that has already got
# through review here. It fails at RUN time, as a syntax error from inside a
# command substitution, so `bash -n` on 5.x does not see it either. Check with
# `/bin/bash scripts/test.test.sh`, not `bash scripts/test.test.sh`.
#
# ZERO BUILDS, ZERO CPU LOAD, AND IT NEVER TOUCHES THE REAL ~/tbd, ~/.claude,
# ~/.codex, ~/Library/Logs/TBD OR THE REAL TMUX SOCKET DIRECTORY. Every case
# here drives the wrapper against a synthetic home under a throwaway fixture
# directory, with a stub
# standing in for `swift`, so the whole file runs in seconds on a shared box
# while other agents are working.
#
# FOUR SEAMS MAKE THAT POSSIBLE, AND EVERY ONE IS A PRODUCTION MECHANISM RATHER
# THAN A TEST-ONLY HOOK — nothing here asks the scripts under test to behave
# differently because they are under test:
#
#   HOME              scripts/test.sh reads the caller's real `$HOME` to derive
#                     the shared lock path, and `scripts/tbd-home-fingerprint.sh`
#                     reads it to decide what to fingerprint. Point it at a
#                     fixture and both observe the fixture instead.
#   TMPDIR            the fake home is `$TMPDIR/tbd-test-fakehome.<uid>`, so a
#                     fixture TMPDIR gives each case its own fake home and its
#                     own decoys.
#   TMUX_TMPDIR       the wrapper OVERWRITES it for the run but the fingerprint
#                     reads the caller's value, so a fixture value stands in for
#                     "the developer's real /tmp/tmux-<uid>" on both sides. Every
#                     run through `run_script` gets one, so no case can observe —
#                     or litter — the real socket directory.
#   TBD_SWIFT_BIN     `scripts/swift-safe` execs this instead of `swift`. The
#                     stub records the environment and argv it was handed, and
#                     can be told to misbehave — chmod a decoy back, write into
#                     the fixture's real home as a leak would, or leave tmux
#                     sockets behind in the fenced directory as a real run does.
#
# Using TBD_SWIFT_BIN rather than stubbing out `swift-safe` itself is
# deliberate: the admission-lock cases below then exercise the REAL lock
# acquisition, so "the fenced run takes the shared lock" is proven by the shared
# lock file containing this run's details rather than by reading an assignment.
#
# EVERY GUARD IS MUTATION-CHECKED. `mutant_of` builds a copy of the script with
# one guard deliberately weakened, the case re-runs against it, and the verdict
# has to flip. A guard whose test passes for reasons unrelated to the guard is the
# failure mode this file exists to prevent: the PR that added these guards
# proved them once, by hand, and nothing would have noticed them rotting.
# shellcheck disable=SC2329 # test_* are dispatched dynamically via `declare -F` below
# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the sed mutation expressions must NOT expand here
# shellcheck disable=SC2088 # `~/tbd` in expectations is the fingerprint's literal output, not a path
set -uo pipefail
# THE FIXTURES' MODES ARE ASSERTED, SO THE UMASK CANNOT BE AMBIENT. Several
# cases pin an exact mode on a directory this file created with `mkdir -p`,
# which yields 0777 masked by the umask — 755 at the common 022, but 700 at a
# hardened 077, where those assertions would red with nothing actually wrong.
# Pinning it here makes every fixture mode a property of this harness rather
# than of whoever ran it. It does NOT weaken any guard: every mode the wrapper
# itself sets, it sets with an explicit `chmod`.

#
# The `-u` list matters: this harness may itself be running under a fenced
# session, and an inherited TBD_HOME or TBD_SWIFT_LOCK_PATH would silently
# change which branch of the lock resolution is under test. Every OTHER knob
# `scripts/swift-safe` reads is cleared for the same reason — the cases below
# run the REAL wrapper, so a developer's exported TBD_SWIFT_JOBS decides
# whether a forwarded `-j 2` is admitted at all, and an exported timeout,
# heartbeat or orphan hatch decides how the admission-lock cases wait.
# TBD_SWIFT_BIN is the deliberate exception: this harness sets it itself, below.
#
# `TMUX_TMPDIR` is pinned rather than unset, and it stands in for the
# DEVELOPER'S REAL socket directory: the wrapper overwrites it for the run, so
# what the fixture value actually controls is which directory the fingerprint
# observes on both sides. Leaving it unset would point that at the real
# `/tmp/tmux-<uid>`, where a live daemon on a developer box creates and removes
# sockets throughout — the fingerprint cases would flake, and they would be
# reporting the machine rather than the wrapper. It doubles as the bogus
# inherited value the overwrite case asserts against.
#
# `RUN_CWD` names the directory to run from, and it is a seam of the same kind:
# `scripts/test.sh` resolves `scripts/swift-safe`, `scripts/remote-verify.sh`
# and the fingerprint script relative to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so a
# case that wants a stub in place of one of them puts the wrapper in a fixture
# repository rather than asking the wrapper for an override it would never need
# in production. Empty means "wherever the harness was invoked" — the real repo
# — which is what every case outside section 7 wants.
#
# `RUN_TEE` names a file the run's output is STREAMED to while it happens.
# `RUN_OUT` is a command substitution, so it exists only once the run is over —
# which is no use to a case that must observe a run mid-flight and act on what
# it sees (the lock-contention cases in section 7). `pipefail` is on for this
# file, and `tee` never fails, so `RUN_RC` is still the wrapper's own status.
# Empty means `/dev/null`, which is every other case.

# `SIGHUP` (`Sources/TBDHolder/Holder.swift`) so it can survive the daemon's
# death. A fixture's holder inherits that, so it survives the test process too,
# re-parents to launchd, and keeps its job running — and `rm -rf` on the scratch
# root unlinks its socket without touching it. Nothing in the product reclaims
# one: `OrphanGC`'s rowless-holder collector enumerates the real `~/tbd/holders`,
# and `AgentReaper`'s holder leg works from `terminal` rows a fixture's in-memory
# database never had. One measured instance ran for 24 hours with its job still
# looping.
#
# THE SWEEP IS BY RESOURCE, NEVER BY PATTERN, and that is the constraint the
# cases here are shaped around: this machine runs live production holders and
# other people's agents, so a `pkill` on the binary's name would end somebody
# else's session. Only "who has this exact socket open" is safe.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. The remote verification valve
#
# `scripts/test.sh` is the only caller that opts in. When `TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY=1`
# it bounds its queueing with `TBD_SWIFT_QUEUE_YIELD_SECONDS`, and `swift-safe`
# answers 76 — "I gave up my place in the queue, having compiled nothing" — at
# which point the verdict is fetched from CI instead.
#
# TWO EXIT CODES CARRY THE WHOLE DESIGN AND BOTH ARE EASY TO GET WRONG:
#
#   76 vs 75.  `swift-safe` exits 75 for a wait that TIMED OUT or was ABANDONED
#              and 76 only for a yield it was ASKED for. Routing a 75 to CI
#              would dispatch a run nobody is waiting for; treating a 76 as a
#              test failure would report a red suite that never compiled.
#   78 vs 1.   `remote-verify.sh` exits 78 for a REFUSED precondition, which
#              must fall back to a local run — the valve is an optimisation,
#              never a gate — and 1 for a remote run that genuinely FAILED,
#              which is the verdict.
#
# AND ONE MISCONFIGURATION LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A RED SUITE. `swift-safe` rejects
# a non-positive, nan, inf or non-numeric yield bound with `SystemExit`, which
# exits 1 — the same code a failing suite returns. `TBD_REMOTE_VERIFY_YIELD_SECONDS=0`
# is the plausible way to spell "always go remote", so the bound is validated
# here, before the run starts, and refused with its own code and its own name.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The spec's threshold, sized against remote capacity rather than impatience:
# two hours of sampled contention put T=60 at ~28 trips an hour against a
# remote that sustains ~12 runs an hour, while T=300 trips four or five times
# and fires only on the tail the valve exists for.

#
#   GREEN transfers. Every test passed, so every subset of them passed. Adopted,

# '^TBDDaemonLiveTests\.'` and `--filter '^TBDDaemonLiveTests\.'`), the nightly
# stress harness forwards a filter, and four of five live queued test lanes were

# 7d. A listing invocation never arms the valve at all
#
# `--list-tests`, and the bare `list` subcommand that spells the same thing, ask
# for OUTPUT rather than a verdict: they run nothing and print method names, and
# those names are the whole answer. The remote path produces a verdict, and a
# verdict answers that question in NEITHER direction — green would exit 0 having
# printed no name the caller asked for, red would report failures for a run that
# was never going to run a test.
#
# SO THE GATE IS AT THE ARMING, NOT AT THE VERDICT. Routing a listing run and
# salvaging it on the way back would spend a whole CI dispatch on a question CI
# cannot answer and then run locally anyway. Not arming has to leave the run in
# the PRE-VALVE state exactly — no routing AND the yield bound cleared — which is
# what the inherited-bound case below is for: `env` passes an inherited
# `TBD_SWIFT_QUEUE_YIELD_SECONDS` straight through, so merely declining to set it
# would strand a listing run at 76 with nothing printed and nothing routed.

# The bound is still VALIDATED for a listing run, because a malformed one is a

# 7c. The count in the log has to describe the run being reported
#
# Six consumers decide whether a run is trustworthy by grepping its log for
# `Test run with N tests` and taking the FIRST match — `scripts/git-hooks/
# pre-push` (which pipes both streams into its log), `scripts/nightly-flake-
# stress.sh`, and three floors in `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
#
# On the narrowed-red path two runs speak into one log, and only the second's
# verdict is reported: the remote whole-suite report prints first, then the local
# re-run. A remote count left in there is read as the reported run's population.
# THE CONCRETE FAILURE that closes is pre-push's tier-3 pass — `--filter
# '^TBDDaemonLiveTests\.'`, floor 35, a floor that exists precisely to catch a
# filter that matched nothing. Rename the type, and the local re-run selects
# zero tests, exits 0, and says `Test run with 0 tests`; with a whole-suite
# count ahead of it in the log the floor sees four thousand, is satisfied, and
# the push is allowed.
#
# The wrapper therefore declares its narrowing with `--narrowed`, and the driver
# omits the count from a FAILING report only. Green keeps its count: there the
# remote verdict is the one adopted, and a floor is a minimum measured against a
# superset.
