# Every product a running installation needs. scripts/restart.sh and
# scripts/update.sh both build exactly this list, so a product added here
# reaches both paths. TBDCLI, TBDHolder, TBDPeerHelper and TBDModelProxy are
# each found by a SIBLING lookup beside the daemon binary, and a sibling that
# was never built fails in the field rather than in the build:
#
#   TBDDaemon      launched in place from .build/<config>.
#   TBDApp         hard-linked into the .app bundle by assemble_app_bundle.
#   TBDCLI         `tbd`. Every replacement agent process is handed the
#                  daemon's sibling copy as TBD_CLI_PATH and its hooks run that
#                  one, swallowing the error when it is missing
#                  (AgentProcessEnvironment, ClaudeHookOverlay,
#                  CodexHomeManager). update.sh also re-links an existing
#                  ~/.local/bin/tbd hard link to it.
#   TBDHolder      the pty holder the daemon spawns for a holder-backed session
#                  (HolderSpawner.locateSiblingExecutable). Missing, the daemon
#                  reports ptyHolderSupported=false: the Settings toggle greys
#                  out, and a toggle that was already on sends every new
#                  session to tmux with no error.
#   TBDPeerHelper  the shadow-peer helper for remote peer messaging
#                  (ShadowPeerHelperProcessSpawner). Missing, a remote lane
#                  fails to arm with executableMissing.
#   TBDModelProxy  the loopback model proxy the daemon spawns once per TBD home
#                  (ModelProxySupervisor). Missing, the daemon reports the
#                  model-proxy capability unsupported: sessions spawn unproxied
#                  and transcript streaming silently never starts, which is the
#                  same never-built-helper failure the holder had.
#
# Every product here is all-or-nothing: a helper that fails to compile stops
# the restart or update the same way a daemon that fails to compile does. That
# is deliberate. Each helper degrades gracefully at runtime when it is ABSENT,
# and that graceful path is exactly how a never-built helper went unnoticed;
# building it as a warning would put the same silent degradation one scroll
# above the "Daemon ready" line. The holder and peer helper depend on
# TBDShared and nothing else, the model proxy on TBDShared plus SwiftNIO, and
# the CLI on TBDShared plus packages the daemon also links, so a helper that
# fails while the daemon builds is a broken tree, and a broken tree is what a
# restart should refuse.
#
# scripts/restart-bundle-lib.test.sh checks that each name is an executable
# target in Package.swift, so a rename or typo fails there and not on the next
# restart.

    # `.build/.../<Pkg>_<Target>.bundle` path baked in at compile time, which
    # happens to resolve on the machine that built the binary — so a missing
    # bundle looks fine here and breaks anywhere else. Code that probes for its
