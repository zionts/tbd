#  - Re-signing with --force --deep makes the codesign identifier match

#    TBDApp-<hash>, which macOS uses for permission tracking and rejects.
#  - /Applications is the only path macOS 15 accepts for requestAuthorization;
#    bundles elsewhere return UNErrorDomain Code=1 with no permission dialog.
#  - cp -cR uses APFS clonefile (copy-on-write, ~zero disk cost).
#  - All TBD worktrees share CFBundleIdentifier=com.tbd.app, so whichever
#    worktree most recently ran restart.sh "wins" /Applications — same
#    last-restart-wins behavior already documented for tbd:// URL routing.
# Prefer a stable self-signed identity so TCC permission grants/denials persist
# across rebuilds. Ad-hoc signing (`--sign -`) gives TCC only a bare cdhash with
# no stable anchor, so every rebuild — and even repeated accesses within one
# build, when access is attributed via a spawned child like a `claude` session —
# fails the stored code-requirement check and re-prompts (Desktop/Documents/
# Downloads/Photos/etc.). A persistent leaf-cert anchor fixes that.
# One-time setup creates the "TBD Dev Signing" identity in a dedicated
# tbd-signing keychain (see docs/tcc-signing.md). If it's absent (e.g. a fresh
# clone or another contributor's machine), fall back to ad-hoc so restart still works.
