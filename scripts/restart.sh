# here — a revived dormant worktree — would otherwise be Tier-2 eligible at
# plan time, before the new build has touched it). So kick it off now,
# before the build below, so the two overlap instead of the reclaim adding
# to wall-clock time. Fully async and fire-and-forget: never
# blocks restart.sh, never fails it, and outlives this script (and the
# terminal). nohup alone is sufficient detachment here: this shell is
# non-interactive (job control / monitor mode is off, so the child is never
# tied to a terminal job), nohup makes it immune to SIGHUP, and all three
# fds are redirected away from the terminal. Silent — output appends to

# MARK: - Build
#
# The shared clang/Swift module cache is NOT selected here. scripts/swift-safe
# points every governed compile at it, so `build`, `test` and `run` all plan
# identically. Passing the flags from here as well is how that agreement was
# lost before: SwiftPM bakes the cache path into .build/debug.yaml at plan
# time, so a tree that alternated between this script and the wrapper fully
# recompiled on every transition, in both directions. See
# docs/specs/2026-08-30-shared-module-cache-design.md.

# Everything below this point ships what is in .build/<config> — it assembles
# the bundle, copies it over /Applications/TBD.app, and restarts the shared
# daemon. So a build that did not succeed must stop the script here, before
# any of that. The status of the governed build is CAPTURED, never read
# through a pipe: `scripts/swift-safe … | tail -3` reports tail's status
# (always 0), so `set -e` never fires and a build that compiled nothing is
# indistinguishable from one that succeeded — which is how an 1800s lock
# timeout (exit 75) once relaunched the app and daemon machine-wide from
# stale binaries. run_governed_build keeps the output trimming and returns
# the real status; see scripts/restart-build-lib.sh (harness:
# scripts/restart-build-lib.test.sh). `--quick`/`--skip-build` is unaffected:
# shipping the existing binaries is the point there, and no build was
