"""Run the real `claude` CLI against a fake model API — zero tokens, offline.

A mock/stub of the Anthropic Messages API stands in for the model, so a real
`claude` session (interactive TUI or `-p` headless) runs end to end without
spending tokens and without a real API key: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at a
loopback server started here, and every answer is scripted locally. Nothing
leaves the machine.

The fake server itself is `stub_server.py` under
`.github/workflows/claude-review-v2/tests/e2e/` (SSE streaming, canned turns,
content-keyed routing); this wrapper makes it usable outside the review gate.
See `docs/fake-model-api.md`.

    """Serve the fake API for one run, and reclaim the sandbox afterwards.

    The stop-signal handlers go on first, before a single resource exists, so
    any of SIGTERM, SIGHUP and SIGINT arriving anywhere below — building the
    sandbox, binding the stub server, spawning claude — unwinds through the
    cleanup instead of taking the interpreter's default disposition. The
    handler itself never raises; a signal no phase owns is recorded and the
    next `raise_if_stopped` below unwinds it, which is what keeps a signal
    that lands where CPython discards exceptions from being lost. Once the
    run is finishing — the child waited for, the `--print-env` server stopped,
    or the run failing its way into the cleanup below — a stop signal is
    instead recorded and swallowed, so the last few milliseconds of summary and
    sandbox removal cannot be interrupted either, and the status stays the one
    the child exited with. The guarantee is the same for all three: only
    SIGKILL or a hard crash can leave the sandbox on disk or the child
    unwaited-for.

    What the three do differs only for SIGINT, and only by where the wrapper
    sits: as the terminal's foreground process group it treats a SIGINT as a
    Ctrl-C `claude` already received and does not forward it, whatever sent it,
    while a SIGINT arriving with no controlling terminal or from the background
    is forwarded like any other. SIGTERM is the signal for stopping the wrapper
    and its child from outside.

    `SIGNAL_TARGETS` is module-level so the handler can reach it without a
    closure, which means it also outlives a single call: a process that calls
    `main` more than once (the in-process tests do) would otherwise start a
    run already `finishing` from the previous one's own cleanup — swallowing
    every stop signal instead of unwinding or forwarding it — and would report
    a `late_signums` entry that a *previous* run answered as this run's own.
    Resetting the three fields below closes both.

    The reset and the handler installation are one step with respect to a stop
    signal, held off across the pair by the mask, because a second-or-later
    call to `main` starts with whatever disposition the process was left
    holding — and every one of them mishandles a signal landing mid-reset. If
    an earlier caller left `handle_stop_signal` installed, the handler reads
    the half-reset state: `finishing` is still `True` from the previous run,
    so the signal is swallowed onto a `late_signums` the very next statement
    replaces, and `raise_if_stopped` — which only ever consults
    `unowned_signums` — never sees it, so the run spawns `claude` and waits on
    it. If instead the default disposition is back (what
    `restore_signal_handlers` leaves at the end of the previous call), SIGTERM
    and SIGHUP kill the interpreter where it stands and SIGINT raises a
    `KeyboardInterrupt` from outside the `try` that would have answered it.
    Masked, the signal merely stays pending across both, and is delivered on
    unmask to a handler reading a fully reset state: nothing owns it, so it is
    recorded as unowned and the first `raise_if_stopped` below — reached
    before the sandbox exists — unwinds it into the 128 + signum exit.
