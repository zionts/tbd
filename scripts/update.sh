# TBD update script — move the whole installation to the latest main.
#
# `tbd update` is a thin wrapper that execs this file out of the running
# daemon's source worktree. The procedure itself lives here, in user-land,
# because the policy in it is the part most likely to want changing: how many
# sessions to wake at once, whether to restart the app, which configuration to
# build. See docs/updating.md for the operator's view and
# docs/specs/2026-09-04-automatic-version-updates-design.md for why.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/update.sh              # build the latest main and hand the fleet over
#   scripts/update.sh --check      # report how far behind the daemon is, then stop
#   scripts/update.sh --dry-run    # fetch and build, install nothing
#   scripts/update.sh --debug      # build the debug configuration
#   scripts/update.sh --no-app     # leave the running app alone
#   scripts/update.sh --no-wake    # install, but wake no parked session
#   scripts/update.sh --wake-only  # wake recovery-parked sessions, update nothing
#   scripts/update.sh --auto       # non-interactive; what the daemon launches
#   scripts/update.sh --remote <url>  # fetch from this URL instead of the default

Usage: tbd update [options]

Builds the latest main out of place and hands the running installation over to
it without killing live sessions. Sessions the new daemon's startup reconcile
parks anyway are woken afterwards, a few at a time.

Options:
  --check          Report the running daemon's commit against the latest main
                   and exit. Changes nothing.
  --dry-run        Fetch and build, then stop. Installs nothing, hands nothing
                   over, and leaves the running installation untouched.
  --debug          Build the debug configuration instead of release.
  --no-app         Do not restart TBDApp. The daemon still hands over.
  --no-wake        Do not wake sessions the new daemon parked.
  --wake-only      Wake recovery-parked sessions against the daemon that is
                   already running. Builds and installs nothing.
  --auto           Non-interactive. Logs to the update log only, and refuses
                   to run while another update holds the lock.
  --remote <url>   Fetch from this URL instead of the daemon worktree's
                   upstream (else origin) remote.
  --help           Show this message.

# Taking over a stale lock has two requirements the create alone cannot meet,
# and each gets its own atomic primitive.
#
# The lock path must never be vacant. If a takeover removed the lock, or moved
# it aside and put it back, a third run's noclobber create could land in that
# gap and believe it holds an exclusive lock while somebody else believes the
# same. So the replacement is a rename over the path: the temp file is written
# beside the lock as `<lock>.new.<pid>` and `mv`d onto it, and rename(2)
# replaces the entry atomically — every create attempt in flight either sees
# the old file or the new one, and none of them ever sees nothing there.
#
# Only one run at a time may replace it. Deciding a lock is stale and then
# replacing it is a read followed by a write, and two runs can both read the
# same dead pid. The takeover critical section is guarded by `mkdir` on
# `<lock>.takeover`, which is atomic on every filesystem worth having: whoever
# creates the directory owns the right to replace the lock, and re-reads it
# inside the section, so a lock that turned live in the meantime is refused
# rather than stolen. Runs that lose the mkdir go back to the create.
#
# An abandoned mutex must not deadlock every later run, and a live one must
# never be taken from under its holder. The directory records its creator's
# pid in `owner` the instant it exists, and is reclaimed only when it is older
# than a minute AND that pid is gone (or was never written, which is a run
# that died between the mkdir and the write). The critical section is a read
# and a rename, so a minute is generous — but a holder stalled inside it by a
# suspended machine or a hung filesystem still owns the section for as long
# as its process lives.
# The create itself IS the decision for the ordinary path. Under `set -C` bash
# opens the redirection target with O_EXCL, so of any number of runs starting
# at once — a manual `tbd update` racing the daemon's auto-launch — exactly one
# create succeeds and every loser sees a file that is already there. A check
# followed by a separate write would let two callers both pass the check and
# the second clobber the first, and both would then build and install against
# the same clone.
#
# A lock naming THIS process is one we already hold. `exec` keeps the pid, so
# the self-re-exec in maybe_reexec arrives here still holding it; the
# alternative — releasing before the exec — opens a window in which a second
# update can start against the same clone.
