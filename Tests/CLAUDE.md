# Tests

## Shared-box hazards

Reproducing a flake means inducing load, and this box runs several agent
worktrees at once. Every entry below was paid for during the test-hardening
program. They are one family, not four anecdotes — the next variant will be a
fifth way to kill or mismeasure something you did not mean to.

### The kill hazards

**One rule covers all of them: kill by captured PID or by your own process
tree (`pkill -P $$`). Never by name pattern, never by process group.**

- **`kill $(jobs -p)`** — job control is OFF in the non-interactive tool shell,
  so `jobs -p` returns nothing, `kill` reaps nothing, and every backgrounded
  `&` child orphans to launchd and runs forever. (Once leaked 22 `yes`
  processes at ~850% CPU for a week.)
- **`trap 'kill 0' EXIT`** — signals the whole process group, which includes
  your own tool shell. This file used to recommend it; it does not any more.
  It cost this program a stress run, and two slices had it in their plans.
- **`pkill -f <pattern>`** — matches **across worktrees**. Every worktree
  builds identically-named bundles, so `pkill -f TBDPackageTests` kills a
  sibling agent's test run. Cost: ~70 minutes of someone else's work.
- **Orphaned subagent subtrees** — stopping a parent *orphans* its children
  rather than killing them, and the orphans keep obeying the rules that were
  in force when they were spawned. An agent audited its own load, stopped the
  subagent it knew about, verified `pgrep` was clean, and still contaminated
  the box.

That last one generalizes into three habits worth more than the rule itself:

1. When a coordination rule lands, enumerate what is actually **running** —
   processes, not your mental model of your agents.
2. A stop is not a guarantee the subtree is gone. **Re-check after stopping.**
3. Judge by **capability, not current behaviour**. An idle child that can fire
   a build is a load generator that happens to be between jobs — `pgrep` came
   back clean only because the children were momentarily between builds.

For a long-lived helper, prefer the Bash tool's `run_in_background` option,
which the harness tracks and reaps. The `jobs -p` shape is also blocked
mechanically at PreToolUse time by the `background-jobs` rule in
`.claude/hooks/guardrails`.

### The same class, without a signal: the machine lying in your vocabulary

A shared box also breaks builds in ways that read as broken code.

- **Disk at 100%** surfaces as `generate-dSYM command failed` and `link
  command failed` — errors that look exactly like a bad diff. **If a build or
  link dies strangely, check `df` before debugging the diff.**
- **Load average in the hundreds** turns clock-driven suites red on their
  arming handshake, and CI-contention reds look like real assertion failures.

Same family as the kill hazards and as the instrument-calibration failures
below: the machine failing in the vocabulary of your own code. When your slice
merges and you stand down, delete your own `.build` — and reclaim only your
own, never a sibling's, because a rebuild costs them ~2 minutes and silently
invalidates any measurement they are midway through.

## Running the suite — `scripts/test.sh`, never bare `swift test`

Every invocation in this file, in `test.yml` and in the pre-push hook goes
through `scripts/test.sh`, which forwards its arguments to `swift test` behind a
scratch `TBD_HOME` / `TBD_SOCKET_PATH` / `TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME` /
`TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME` / `TMUX_TMPDIR`, plus a `TBD_TEST_SCRATCH_ROOT` naming
that scratch dir itself — the one the EXIT trap deletes — for the few fixtures
that must mint a short socket-bearing root of their own and need it reclaimed
even on a killed run. Bare `swift test` writes into the
developer's real `~/tbd`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` and `/tmp/tmux-<uid>` — 18k
orphan profile dirs, ~2.9k fake worktrees and ~7,100 dead tmux sockets
accumulated that way before anyone noticed. Read `swift test …` below
as `scripts/test.sh …`.

**Two of the things a run leaves behind are processes, and no amount of path
fencing touches either.** A tmux server outlives the socket that named it, and a
`TBDHolder` outlives the test process that spawned it *by design* — it calls
`setsid()` and ignores `SIGHUP` so it can survive the daemon's death
(`Sources/TBDHolder/Holder.swift`), which means it survives a dead test process
just as well, re-parents to launchd, and keeps its job running. Nothing in the
product reclaims a fixture's holder: `OrphanGC`'s rowless-holder collector
enumerates the real `~/tbd/holders`, and `AgentReaper`'s holder leg works from
`terminal` rows an in-memory fixture database never had. One measured instance
ran for 24 hours with its job still looping. Three layers cover the three ways
one can be left behind, and each covers exactly one:

- **A teardown that runs** kills what its rows name, then sweeps the pids it
  remembers — refusing any whose kernel start time no longer matches the one
  recorded at spawn. That identity check is what makes remembering a pid safe:
  a pid is free the instant its corpse is collected, and on this box the next
  process to take it is somebody else's. It is the same answer `AgentReaper`
  gives to the same question.
- **A run that dies without reaching a teardown** leaves its rendezvous sockets
  behind, and `cleanup` kills whoever `lsof` says owns each one before the
  `rm -rf`. **By resource, never by pattern**: the socket path is unique to the
  run, while a `pkill` on the holder's name would end live production holders
  and other agents' sessions on the same machine. Note the ordering this
  implies — a teardown that ran and removed its scratch root has taken the
  socket with it, which is precisely why the layer above exists.
- **A wrapper that is SIGKILLed**, where not even the EXIT trap runs, is
  reclaimed by the *next* run: `reclaim_abandoned_run_roots` gives every sibling
  `/tmp/tbd-test-home.*` that is both older than a day and has no live owner the
  same two sweeps, then removes it. Every run being a sweep is what makes the
  machine heal as soon as anybody tests again, with no timer and no daemon. It
  is the named reconciler for fixture holders in the sense
  `docs/specs/2026-08-15-named-reconciler-doctrine-design.md` means it.

  **Age is not the whole discriminator, and the missing half is the dangerous
  one.** No run lasts a day, so age says nobody is coming back — but a run that
  WEDGES stops writing, so its root ages exactly like an abandoned one while its
  holder, its tmux servers and its `TBD_HOME` are all still in use. So every run
  claims its own root on the way in, writing its pid and that pid's kernel start
  time into `<root>/.run-owner`, and the reconciler skips any root whose claim
  still checks out. Same identity check as everywhere else here: a pid alone
  would be a number the kernel is free to reissue. A root with no claim in it
  predates the mechanism and is reclaimed on age — the one arm that is
  deliberately not keep-biased, because immortal roots are the leak.

The tmux leg is the one with no teardown remedy: **tmux never unlinks its
socket file when a server exits.** It unlinks a stale socket lazily instead, at
bind time, when a new server claims that exact path — and every test mints a
fresh UUID-suffixed name, so nothing ever reclaims one. Killing your server in
a `defer` is still worth doing (it stops the orphan *process*, which the
wrapper also sweeps on exit) but it cannot remove the file. If you spawn tmux
through a `Process` whose `environment` you build from scratch, propagate
`TMUX_TMPDIR` into it or every socket that run creates lands outside the fence,
permanently; `TestSupport.shell(_:at:)` already does.

Four of those first five variables only fence code that *asks* where home is, and
`TMUX_TMPDIR` is the odd one out — it fences a store that has nothing to do
with `$HOME`, and tmux consults it without anyone in this tree asking. The
wrapper also sets `HOME` and `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` at a **separate** scratch home
whose `tbd`, `.claude` and `.codex` entries are pre-created mode `000`. That covers
the code that assembles a path out of the home directory instead of asking: it
gets `EACCES` at the call site, inside the failing test, with the offending path
in the error.

**So if a test fails with "You don't have permission to save the file …" on a
path ending in `/tbd/…`, `/.claude/…` or `/.codex/…`, read it as: this code
hand-built a home path instead of going through `TBDConstants` (for TBD's own
dirs and, via `claudeHostHome`, the host Claude store) or `CodexHomeManager`
(for the Codex store).** On a developer box the same line writes into the real
store. Fix the resolution; never relax the decoy.

That scratch home is itself checked before anything is chmod'd: it must be a
real directory (never a symlink) owned by the calling uid, and it lives under
`$TMPDIR`, which darwin makes per-user. Under `/tmp` — mode 1777 — anyone could
pre-create the path as a symlink, and `mkdir -p` through a symlink-to-a-directory
succeeds silently while `chmod` resolves straight through it; pointed at `$HOME`
that turned the decoy loop into `chmod 000` on the developer's real `~/tbd` and
`~/.claude`. The decoys are re-checked *after* the run too, since code inside it
owns them and can chmod them back.

Two things the fence does *not* cover, so the existing disciplines stay
load-bearing: `UserDefaults` (resolved by `cfprefsd` over XPC, hence the
`AppState(userDefaults:)` rule in the root `CLAUDE.md`) and the Keychain, which
breaks rather than redirects under `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` — Keychain-touching code
must be reached through an injection seam such as
`ClaudeCredentialsKeychainDeleting`. Account-database home lookups
(`getpwuid`/`getpwnam`/`getpwent`, `NSHomeDirectoryForUser(_:)`,
`FileManager.homeDirectory(forUser:)`) and hardcoded `/Users/<name>/` paths
escape both variables outright and are rejected mechanically by the
`no_passwd_home_lookup` and `no_hardcoded_users_path` SwiftLint rules — the
second covers `Tests/TBDSharedTests` and `Tests/TBDAppTests` as well, matches
the dash-encoded `-Users-<name>-` form Claude Code scratchpad paths use, and
fires in comments too, because a real username in a doc comment is a leak in a
public repo even though it cannot open a file. Use `me` / `acme` / `x` / `test`
in examples.

Neither of those is the shape the leaks actually took, so a third rule covers
it. Every one of them went through the ordinary, fence-*honouring*
`homeDirectoryForCurrentUser` / `NSHomeDirectory()` and then appended `tbd`,
`.claude` or `.codex` — which resolves to the real store because it never
consults `TBD_HOME` / `TBD_CLAUDE_HOST_HOME` / `TBD_TEST_CODEX_HOME` at all.
`no_home_relative_store_path` fires on a home lookup followed within 80
characters by one of those three as a whole path component, which is narrow
enough to leave the ~20 legitimate home lookups (tilde-abbreviation for
display, `~/Library` fallbacks, defaulted injection seams, `~/.ssh/tbd-agent.sock`)
untouched. Three sites carry a reasoned inline suppression: `Constants.swift`
is excluded outright as the file that *defines* the resolvers, and
`CodexHomeManager`, `ModelProfileKeychain.legacyStorageDir` and the frozen v-24
conductors migration name a real path deliberately. Its limit is worth knowing
before trusting it: the home value has to be visible near the append, so a path
built from a `home` that arrived as a parameter matches nothing. It narrows the
shape rather than closing it.

The wrapper's last layer, a before/after fingerprint of the five real
directories, is on when `$CI` is set and off otherwise; `--fingerprint` opts in
locally and `--no-fingerprint` forces it off. The default follows the argument
rather than contradicting it: a live daemon and sibling worktrees write to
`~/tbd` legitimately for the whole duration of a local run, and any concurrent
agent session starting in a new directory mints a fresh
`~/.claude/projects/<cwd-hash>`. It is a backstop,
not the primary guard: it compares directory *listings*, so a leak that writes
to a fixed path — or one that cleans up after itself in a `defer` — is invisible
to it, while the tripwire fails on the permission check every run regardless.
Full rationale is in the wrapper's header.

The wrapper's own guards are regression-tested by `scripts/test.test.sh`, which
runs in the `lint` CI job: it drives the symlink and ownership refusals on the
fake home, the post-run mode-000 recheck, the fingerprint's seven arms (five
roots, two of which are read twice), the tmux socket fence (its `sun_path`
budget and its kill-server sweep), the holder sweep and the abandoned-run-root
reconciler, and the
shared-lock pin against fixture directories with a stub `swift`, so it takes
~11 s, builds nothing, and touches no real store. **Every case there is
mutation-checked** — the assertion is shown going red against a deliberately
weakened copy of the script. If you change a guard, change its case; if you add
one, add a case. The guards were proven once by hand when they landed, and that
is not a regression test.

## Test tiers

Three tiers, defined by what a test may touch: tier 1 (deterministic,
in-process state only — no real sleeps, subprocesses, tmux, network, or
`~/tbd`), tier 2 (in-process integration — real concurrency, real filesystem,
real git subprocesses, deadlines only via bounded waits), tier 3
(live-external — real tmux server, real `ps`, spawned processes, the replay
firehose). Full taxonomy: `docs/specs/2026-07-24-test-hardening-design.md` §3.

Tier 3 suites live in `Tests/TBDDaemonLiveTests/`. A suite belongs there if
and only if its runtime depends on an external process it does not fully
control: it spawns a real tmux server, shells out to `ps`, spawns a child
racing a deadline, or drives the replay firehose. CI runs that target
serially on an otherwise-idle machine, in a separate step from the fast
parallel pass.

That step passes `--no-parallel` explicitly. Omitting `--parallel` is **not**
equivalent: SwiftPM's `--parallel` governs XCTest's process-level sharding,
while Swift Testing parallelizes suites in-process regardless. Measured here,
the difference is all 17 live suites starting simultaneously versus running
one at a time.

The failure asymmetry is the thing reviewers get wrong: leaving a heavy suite
in the parallel pass is merely the status quo, but moving a fast
deterministic suite into the serial pass taxes every PR forever. When in
doubt, leave it in the parallel pass.

## Population is the scheduler, and it is a moving target

Swift Testing runs every non-serialized test in **one process with no
concurrency cap**, and all targets compile into that process. So per-test
scheduling latency scales with the *total* population, not with the suite you
are looking at. Mined CI runs put p50 per-test reported duration at ~1/3 of
total wall time on green runs as well as red — a trivial test "takes" 16–29 s
because it is mostly suspended waiting for a turn. Population went 3013 → 4536
in three weeks. Two consequences, both load-bearing.

**The fast pass is three sequential steps in one job.** `test.yml` runs
`--filter '^TBDDaemonTests\.[A-O]'` (1a), then that filter's complement within
the daemon target (1b), then
`--skip '^(TBDDaemonTests|TBDDaemonLiveTests)\.'` (2), all sharing one build.
Halving the in-flight population halves the tail: measured under induced load
with arms interleaved, means over 5 iterations, p90 26.4 s → 14.6 s and p50
8.8 s → 7.6 s, for **+26 s** of wall time (56 s → 82 s — the second invocation
re-pays SPM's no-op build check and process startup). Quote that figure, not the
+6 s a single iteration showed; it did not survive the other four. Splitting the
daemon target again pays that startup cost a third time and buys the same
halving on the half where the tail actually lives. **Where the cut goes is
measured, not guessed:** cut at `[A-L]` the two halves executed 1918 and 3703,
which is a third and two thirds rather than a halving, so the cut moved to
`[A-O]`. A local count of `@Test` attributed to the top-level suite that
declares it predicted 1919 for that same cut, so use it — it is accurate to
within a test — and re-cut from the counts CI prints whenever the halves drift
apart again. This is not
the "sharding across runners" that
`docs/specs/2026-07-24-test-hardening-design.md` §1 rejected and §2 lists as a
non-goal — that was about extra *jobs* paying the 5-concurrent-macOS-job cap and
a second ~2 min build. **Steps 1b and 2 are complements, not enumerations, and
that is deliberate.** Three `--filter` lists would have reintroduced the hazard
the spec's §3 names when it calls the target boundary "compiler-enforced, cannot
silently zero-match like a `--filter` regex": `swift test --filter` exits GREEN
on zero matches, so a new `TBDFooTests` named in no list would run in
**no** pass with nothing going red — and the floors could not catch that,
because adding a target reduces no existing step's count. Written as
complements, 1b absorbs any daemon suite that falls outside `[A-O]` (including
one renamed to start with a digit) and step 2 absorbs any new target, so the
four passes partition the package by construction. The per-step floors have a
narrower job: catching a target that *is* named in one of these regexes
collapsing or being renamed, where the regex would zero-match or over-skip its
way to a green run of nothing. Keep them updated.

**Wall-clock handshake deadlines are hang-catchers sized against the population
of the day.** `ciSafeDeadline` (`Tests/TBDDaemonTests/ControlModeTestSupport.swift`)
and `waitForSuspension`'s `timeout` / `.clockDriven`'s limit
(`Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`) bound a hang; they assert nothing
and cost passing runs nothing. They are the first things to re-derive when the
population moves materially — that is what turned the `ControlModeInputHealth`,
`ControlModeInputRouter` and "Archived search debounce" reds into a ~42% red
rate on `main` with **zero** logic assertions failing.

**Derive the three together, and know the invariant.** They are currently
`ciSafeDeadline` 90 s, `waitForSuspension` 45 s, `.clockDriven`
`.timeLimit(.minutes(4))` = 240 s. The suite limit and the two wait deadlines
race each other for real: `AttachRPCOrchestrationTests` and
`PaneRepairCoordinatorTests` are both `.clockDriven` **and** consume
`ciSafeDeadline`, across 44 `waitFor` call sites. Every one of those sites is
unguarded — `waitFor` is `@discardableResult` and non-throwing on timeout, so
the test continues and chained waits are real (the `try` covers only the inner
`Task.sleep`).

The rule is **not** "all N chained waits must fit inside the suite limit". That
was never satisfiable — the deepest chain is 6 waits in one
`PaneRepairCoordinator` test, and 6 × 30 s already blew the old one-minute
limit. The rule is:

> The suite limit must afford the **first** full deadline plus the rest of an
> ordinary test. The first timeout's `Issue.record` fires immediately and
> carries the named diagnostic, so it always survives even if the limit later
> truncates the test. Chains beyond the first belong to a test that is already
> failing; truncating those is acceptable and deliberate.

Checked against 240 s: one `waitFor` + one `waitForSuspension` = 135 s ✓; two
`waitFor` = 180 s ✓; two `waitForSuspension` = 90 s ✓ (this is the "a test that
waits twice must afford both waits" property the old pairing was reasoned
from).

**Past that pair the margin is thin — 240 s is not roomy, and the real numbers
are worth knowing before someone reaches for a raise.**
**Count `advanceWhenSuspended` as a `waitForSuspension`** — it opens with one
(`await waitForSuspension(...)`, then `advance`), so it pays the full 45 s
guard. Grepping only for the literal `waitForSuspension(` undercounts every
chain below, which is exactly the miscount a PR #547 reviewer made. Count
`advanceUntil` as **one** guard (45 s) too — it replaces an
`advanceWhenSuspended` plus the `waitFor` that used to follow it, so converting
a site takes 135 s off that test's paper worst case.

**A single advance is the wrong instrument for a poll-and-re-arm loop, and the
failure it produces is a hang, not a red.** `advanceWhenSuspended` proves a
sleeper was armed when it advanced; it cannot prove the loop *observes* the
state the test just created on the probe that follows. Where the code under test
probes external state and re-arms if it is not there yet, one advance stakes the
run on one probe, and a probe that reads "keep waiting" re-arms a sleep nothing
will ever advance again. `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests`' broken-pipe test wedged
in CI that way for its full 240 s limit — one write, `repairing` still set —
and had already done so once before, on a diff that touched only
`Sources/TBDCLI`. Drive those with `advanceUntil` (`Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`),
which advances for as long as the code keeps re-arming and fails with a named
diagnostic carrying the advance count. Keep explicit single advances where the
*number* of advances is the property under test.

**`TestClock.advanceUntil` is for one-shot waits only, though — under the
saturated fast pass it starves the very re-arm it is waiting for.** Its loop
probes `checkSuspension()` every 25 ms, and each of those probes is a
`megaYield`: twenty serially-awaited **background-QoS** tasks. Forty-five
seconds of probing therefore floods the cooperative pool with exactly the
low-priority work a re-arming poller needs a turn from.
The field signature is a diagnostic reading **"observed 1 clock advance"** —
the first tick landed, the second re-arm was never seen — and on 2026-09-08 it
reddened `ModelProxySupervisorTests` on three consecutive dispatches of one
SHA. So a **re-arming** loop belongs on `EventDrivenTestClock`
instead, driven by an explicit ladder of `requireAdvanceWhenArmed` with a
closing `requireSleeperArmed` — the re-arm being the proof that the tick before
it finished. See "The event-driven alternative" below.

On that basis, the deepest chains in the tree are the poller tests, and their
paper tallies do not all fit under the ceiling:

- `GatedIntervalSleepTests.returnsAfterExpectedPollCount` — 3
  `requireAdvanceWhenArmed` + 2 `requireSleeperArmed` + 1 `FireRecorder.next()`
  = **6** guards, 270 s, i.e. **over** the 240 s limit.
- `GatedIntervalSleepTests.boundaryIsExact` (3 + 1 + 1) and
  `DaywatchRunnerLoopTests.testSubsequentTicksAtInterval` (2 + 3) — **5**
  guards, 225 s.

Paper is the operative word, and the arithmetic that matters is different:
**at most one guard can elapse in any single run of these.** All three chains
are on `EventDrivenTestClock`'s **strict** waits, where a missed arming throws
before anything advances, so the chain stops at the first bad step and nothing
after it runs. The one non-throwing guard in each chain — `FireRecorder.next()`,
which records and continues — sits *last*, with no wait behind it to inherit the
run. So the real worst case is one 45 s guard, and 270 s describes a run that
cannot happen. That is a property of these chains' *shape*, not of strictness
alone: put a `next()` mid-chain and its 45 s becomes payable on top of whatever
follows. Suites on the predecessor helpers have no such property at all and pay
the full tally. And counting `waitFor` at 90 s plus
each clock wait at 45 s, **6 of the 13** `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests` have a
worst case above 240 s — not just the 6-deep chain (540 s) usually cited. Every one of those is still consistent with
the invariant, because only an already-failing test walks a full chain of
timeouts and the first diagnostic is already recorded by then.

**The remedy if they start tripping is to shorten the chain, not to raise the
limit again.** "Keep advance chains short — single digits" below is already the
rule, and a 5-deep chain sits at its edge; inject pacing values and cross the
threshold in 2–3 advances. Raising 240 s buys room only for tests that are
already failing, and taxes every genuinely wedged test with a longer wait
before it gets attributed.

**All three are sized for the fast parallel pass, so tier 3 opts out.** The
quiet pass (`--no-parallel`, idle machine) never sees the saturation that forced
`.clockDriven` up, and a tier-3 suite whose time limit is its *regression
detector* rather than a hang guard is actively harmed by the raise — it disarms
a mutation-verified proof with nothing going red. Those pin their own
`.timeLimit(.minutes(1))`: `SubprocessTimeoutStarvationTests` (a `sleep 90`
child must outlive the limit), `GitManagerTimeoutTests` and
`SubprocessTimeoutTests` (a regressed EOF-waiting drain must outlive it). Don't
"tidy" them back to `.clockDriven`; the residual — that 45 s makes two chained
`waitForSuspension`s exceed 60 s — is acceptable only because none of those
suites chains two and a healthy handshake there returns in milliseconds.

**No bounded wait in a fast-pass target carries a literal deadline, and no
fast-pass suite carries a hand-written `.timeLimit`.** A wait takes its deadline
from `TestDeadlines` (`saturatedPass` as a `Duration`, `saturatedPassSeconds` as
a `TimeInterval`), and a suite or test hang guard takes `.fastPassBounded` —
which `.clockDriven` is an alias of, so there is one dial. The evidence is what
the pass's own numbers say about a small number: on a **green** run, fast pass 1
(`^TBDDaemonTests\.`, ~5200 tests) reported p50 65.6 s, p99 92.1 s and max
95.5 s per test, and fast pass 2 (everything else, ~4800 tests) reported p90
51.4 s and max 55.3 s — reported duration being almost entirely time suspended
behind other runnable tests. So a 2–30 s hand-rolled wait sits an order of
magnitude below the healthy latency of the very hop it is guarding, and a
one-minute suite limit sits below pass 1's median and five seconds above pass
2's maximum. Both fire on healthy runs, and both did. Three exceptions, and only
these: a **negative-assertion window** ("nothing fires within X") is the
assertion and is never lengthened; a **discriminating threshold** that decides
between two diagnoses (`FileWatcherTests`' `attemptWindow`) is likewise the
assertion; and a **gate's own self-release cap** takes `TestGate.deadline`,
which is sized to dominate `saturatedPass` so the hold cannot expire mid-
observation. Everything else — including a wait reached only through production
code that hands its work to `Task.detached`, where `gateHoldingTask` cannot
follow and only the bound is yours (see "Thread-blocking gates" below) — takes
the shared constant.

One more thing a reader should not have to mine a log for: the **"71 known
issues" pass 1 reports on every run, and the 11 in pass 2, are deliberate
self-tests wrapped in `withKnownIssue`, not hidden failures** — almost all of
them `EventDrivenTestClockSelfTests` driving its own hang guards to their
diagnostics, plus `BoundedGateWaitTests`' unsignalled gate,
`FlakyQuarantineSelfTests.retriesUntilPass`, and pass 2's
`AppStatePublishFrequencyTests` excess-publish records.

Three remedies are already refuted; don't re-litigate them.

- **Per-suite `.serialized`.** "Archived search debounce" is already
  `.clockDriven, .serialized` and still failed twice in CI. The contention is
  process-global, so serializing one suite does not shrink the queue its waiter
  sits behind. (The advice under "Clock and date seams" still holds for its own
  case — a suite starving *itself*.)
- **`TASK_MEGA_YIELD_COUNT=1`.** Measured across interleaved runs: p90
  26.5/31.2 → 26.0/29.4, p99 26.6 → 27.0. Noise. Real but secondary
  contributor; resolves the open question in issue #496.
- **Blanket retry.** Banned in every tier — see "Quarantine" below.

**The measurement method is the transferable part.** Arms must be
**interleaved, not batched**, with population held constant. An earlier attempt
at this same comparison ran each arm as a block and was invalidated by
uncontrolled load drift from sibling agents on the shared box — the arms
measured different machines, not different configurations.

New tests should state their tier. Tier-1 tests put no real sleep in the
*behaviour under test* — the code under test is driven entirely by virtual
time. The scheduling handshake that observes it may still sleep; see "Clock and
date seams" below for why that is not a tier violation.

## Thread-blocking gates run off the cooperative pool

Some seams can only be held still by blocking the thread that reaches them —
a synchronous date provider, a sink called from a receive loop, a teardown
closure. `DispatchSemaphore` is the right primitive there; **which thread it
blocks is the safety question.**

Swift's cooperative pool is only as wide as the machine has cores, and CI's
`macos-26-arm64` runner has 3. Every suspended task in the process draws on
that pool, including the statement that would release the gate. Park as many
gates as the pool is wide and nothing can reach a `signal()`: the run goes
silent and dies on the step's `timeout-minutes` with zero failing tests, and no
per-test `.timeLimit` fires, because a blocked thread is where cooperative
cancellation cannot reach. Bounding the wait converts the wedge into
starvation, not into health — a bounded holder still owns its thread for the
whole deadline, and innocent suites blow their own 90 s and 120 s
hang-catchers first.

So start the side that will be held with `gateHoldingTask`
(`Tests/TestSupport/BoundedGateSupport.swift`), which pins it and every
default-actor hop it makes to threads the tests own. A gate already reached
from a dedicated `Thread` or a `DispatchQueue` needs nothing. Bound every wait
with `waitForGate` regardless: it is the net under the rule, naming the gate
instead of leaving an anonymous job timeout. `BoundedGateWaitTests` reproduces
the wedge on any machine by deriving its holder count from
`activeProcessorCount`.

**The preference stops at an unstructured task; what moves it is the callee,
not the call site, and where the test does not own the callee only the bound
is left.** SE-0417 carries a task executor preference into child
tasks and default actors and *not* into `Task {}` or `Task.detached`. Several
production seams hand their work to an unstructured task on purpose —
`ShutdownLatch` does, so a cancelled signal handler cannot abandon a shutdown
other callers await — and that work is then scheduled on the cooperative pool
however the test started the call. It is not pinning a thread, and no
`gateHoldingTask` can move it. Where the test owns the callee, inject the
executor into the callee instead: `ShutdownLatch(executor:)` and
`ControlModeInputRouter(executor:)` are those seams, and
`ServerShutdownLatchTests` and the two control-mode input suites build on
`GateExecutor.shared` so their work leaves the shared queue altogether. The
router's case shows the reach: its consumer is one unstructured task, but the
preference carries from there into the `TmuxControlCommandClient` actor and the
paste sends beyond it, so injecting at that single seam takes the whole
delivery pipeline off the pass's queue. Each seam is pinned by a test that
reads `Thread.current.name` from inside the moved work, so dropping the
argument goes red instead of quietly returning to the pool.

**What starves such a handshake is hop count, not priority.** Every task in a
test pass runs at one priority: a test body, a `Task { }`, a `Task.detached { }`
and a `gateHoldingTask { }` all read medium (21), measured on the 3-core CI
runner and pinned by `TaskPriorityParityTests`
(`Tests/TBDDaemonTests/TaskPriorityParityTests.swift`). So nothing in the pass
is queued *behind higher-priority work* — the pool's queue is FIFO among the
~5,000 tasks the pass keeps runnable, and one suspension hop costs the pass's
own per-test latency: p50 65.6 s and p99 92.1 s on a green fast pass 1. A
handshake that needs *k* hops therefore costs *k* × that, and the uninjected
latch needs three or four — each caller starting, reaching the latch and
awaiting the run; the run's own unstructured task starting; then every caller
resuming. That is why CI measured 0 of 8 callers back after 90 s while the
test's own polling task, already runnable, kept reporting on time: 90 s is one
hop's worth of budget for a four-hop handshake. **A bound cannot buy a hop its
turn** — sizing one to fit four hops taxes every healthy run, while injecting
the executor removes the hops from the shared queue and costs nothing. (The one
deliberate exception to the single priority is swift-clocks' `megaYield`, which
creates background-QoS tasks on purpose; see "Clock and date seams".)

Where the test reaches the hop through production code it does not construct —
a server's `stop()` — the bound is all that is left: release a gate from beyond
it at `TestDeadlines.saturatedPass` (90 s) and give the outer observation a
strictly larger budget, so a genuinely lost handshake still reports before the
wedge does. A snappier inner bound reports
starvation the outer bound was sized to tolerate — which is exactly how
`SocketServerSocketOwnershipTests` went red on a 30 s staging gate while every
assertion in the test passed.

**Wait on a gate from a task, not a bare `Thread`, whenever the test owns the
thread.** `Test.current` and `Configuration.current` are task-locals; without
them Swift Testing names an expired gate «unknown» and, rather than lose an
event it cannot route, posts it to every registered event handler — so one
expiry prints as several identical lines and names no test. `gateHoldingTask`
is still off the cooperative pool and carries both, so it costs nothing to
prefer. Where production code owns the thread, «unknown» is unavoidable and
the test's own downstream assertions are what name the failure.

## Quarantine — `.flaky(issue:)`

There is no blanket retry policy, in any tier, and there will not be one:
a retry that nobody named hides a regression, because a test that started
failing 40% of the time when someone broke the code is indistinguishable from
one that was always 40% flaky. A tier-2 test that genuinely needs a retry gets
named quarantine instead.

```swift
@Test(.flaky(issue: 512))
func attachRacesSupersession() async { … }
```

The body re-runs up to 3 times total; the first two failures are suppressed as
known issues and the third is surfaced normally, with its real source location.
**The issue number is required — that is the entire honesty mechanism**, and it
is what lets the nightly audit flag a `.flaky` whose issue is closed, or one
that passed first-try all week, for removal. Anonymous quarantine is a
permanent blind spot.

Rules:

- **Tier 2 only.** A red tier-1 test is a bug, full stop. Tier 3 already has
  its own serial target. Never quarantine either.
- **Open the issue first**, and put the diagnosis in it. Quarantine is a
  deadline, not a resting place.
- The trait is `TestTrait` only, never `SuiteTrait` — a quarantined *suite*
  would let one annotation silence twenty tests.
- **Do not quarantine a test that reports failures from an escaping `Task`.**
  Suppression is scoped to the task tree, and it breaks in both directions
  there. Full detail is in the trait's doc comment,
  `Tests/TestSupport/FlakyTestSupport.swift`.

Every execution of a `.flaky` test — including clean first-try passes, which
are what prove a flake is fixed — appends one JSONL record to
`$TBD_RETRY_METRICS_PATH` (set at the job level in CI, unset locally, where the
trait does no work). Keys: `schema`, `testID`, `issue`, `attempts`, `outcome`
(`passedFirstTry` | `passedOnRetry` | `failed`), `file`, `line`. **That schema
is a consumed API** — the nightly quarantine audit reads it, so adding a key is
fine and changing or removing one means bumping `schema`.

One record in that ledger is *not* a flake report:
`TBDDaemonTests.FlakyQuarantineSelfTests/retriesUntilPass()` is the mechanism's
own self-test, which fails once and passes on retry by design on every run so
that a quarantine mechanism that silently stopped retrying cannot look
identical to a working one. Its issue (#499) is a permanently-open fixture
anchor. **The audit must exclude that exact test ID and no other.**

The same file's `alwaysFails()` fixture shares issue #499 and is deliberately
**not** excluded. It is gated off by `TBD_FLAKY_SELFTEST_FAILURE` and nothing in
CI sets that, so it should contribute no records at all — if `failed` records
for it ever appear in the ledger, the gate has leaked into CI, and the audit
should **report that** rather than filter it away. An exclusion list that grew
to cover it would turn a broken gate into silence.

## Assertion hygiene

Five rules. Each traces to a real flake — provenance kept so the rule sticks.

1. **Assert contracts, not incidents.** Prefer membership (`contains`) over
   `.last` or positional/ordering assertions unless ordering is the
   documented contract. (The paste-failure flake: `delete-buffer` and the
   follow-up keystroke are order-independent effects, so pinning `.last`
   pinned an incident.)
2. **No wall-clock freshness windows.** Bracket with `[before, after]`
   captured around the call, or inject the date. (`resolve_success_bumpsLastUsedAt`
   blew a 5-second window by 0.11 s under CI load.)
3. **No bare `Task.sleep(for:)` as a synchronization primitive in tests.**
   Tier 1 advances a test clock; tiers 2–3 use bounded polling with a
   deadline (`waitFor` style). In `Sources/` this is now mechanical — the
   `no_raw_task_sleep` SwiftLint rule rejects any unsuppressed `Task.sleep`.
   In `Tests/` it stays a review rule: the lint rule deliberately does not
   cover test code, where tier-2/3 bounded polling is legitimate. See
   "Clock and date seams" below for the seam the rule pushes you toward.
4. **Timeout errors must report observed state, not just expected — and the
   report has to survive into the CI summary.** Two halves; the second is the
   one you satisfy accidentally-wrong.

   *Observed, not expected.* `fileBytesMismatch(expected: 6150, actual: 6150)`
   re-read the file *after* the deadline and therefore lied about what it saw;
   `fileBytesUnmatched(expected:observed:correctPrefix:)` is the corrected
   shape.

   *Reaching the summary.* Only `Issue.record(_: some Error)` puts your text on
   the **primary** failure line. Both `#expect(cond, "message")` and
   `Issue.record(String)` demote the message to a trailing `↳` line that **CI
   summaries drop** — measured with a render probe, not assumed. So the
   thrown-`Error` shape this rule already cites is **load-bearing, not
   incidental**: the error is what carries the diagnostic to the place you will
   read it. The failure that established this arrived in CI as bare
   `condition(value → 0)` and `condition(value → 2)`, distinguishable only by
   column number, from two `#expect` calls whose message strings were perfect.
   Verified rendering of the corrected shape:

   ```
   Caught error: FileWatcher: exactly one FD closed (baseline 0) — observed 1
   after polling up to 25.0 seconds
   ```

   Scope: this applies to **timeout and bounded-wait diagnostics**, where the
   expression (`condition(value → 0)`) is uninformative by construction and the
   message *is* the whole finding. It is not a ban on `#expect(cond, "…")` for
   ordinary assertions whose expression already describes itself. There is no
   lint rule for it, deliberately — nothing can mechanically tell a timeout
   diagnostic from an ordinary assertion, and a rule that fired on both would
   be one people disable.

   Consequence for tooling: anything that reads a **CI summary** to extract
   diagnostics will not find them in the `#expect` form. (Readers of the full
   tee'd log are unaffected — the `↳` line is present there.)

5. **Do not hand-write a bounded poll — call `pollUntilTrue`
   (`Tests/TestSupport/BoundedPoll.swift`).** It is the only such loop in the
   suite, and the reason it is the only one is that nine helpers wrote it
   independently and between them got two things wrong. The rule below is what
   it encodes; you need it to review a wait, not to write one.

   **A bounded wait's verdict must come from a probe taken *after* the
   deadline test — never from the loop's exit.** The loop shape everyone writes
   tests the deadline before the condition:

   ```swift
   while ContinuousClock.now < deadline {
       if condition() { return }
       try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(5))
   }
   Issue.record(Timeout(...))          // WRONG: reports a sample up to `timeout` old
   ```

   `Task.sleep` is a floor, not a ceiling. When the resumption lands past the
   deadline the loop exits having last looked at the top — possibly before the
   task it is waiting on ever ran — and reports "never became true" about a
   condition that has been true the whole time. Under the fast parallel pass
   that is the *expected* path, not an exotic one: Swift Testing starts every
   non-serialized test in one process with no concurrency cap, and mined CI
   xUnit puts p50 per-test latency at 56-70 s against a 123-158 s pass, so a
   5 ms step aside routinely returns its turn tens of seconds later. The verdict
   has to be a fresh read:

   ```swift
   if condition() { return }
   Issue.record(Timeout(...))
   ```

   Two corollaries the same flake earned. **Report elapsed, not just the
   budget** — "still not true after 30.0 s" reads identically whether the wait
   polled steadily or got one turn and came back 45 s later, and only the
   second is a scheduling gap. And **`try?` around the poll sleep swallows
   cancellation**, which throws instantly: without a `Task.isCancelled` check
   the loop stops suspending and busy-spins its whole budget away on a
   cooperative thread (measured: 33.7M condition reads in 30 s), then blames the
   call site for a harness cancellation.

   `pollUntilTrue` does all three, and returns `PollOutcome` rather than a
   `Bool` so a caller cannot forget the third case: report a diagnostic on
   `.timedOut` only. `.cancelled` means the harness ended the test, so a
   non-throwing waiter returns silently and a throwing one rethrows
   `CancellationError` — never a fabricated timeout, which would pin the failure
   on an innocent call site. `advanceUntil` is the one wait that cannot delegate,
   because it advances the clock rather than only reading it; it carries the
   guard itself.

   (Provenance: PR #716 attempts 1 and 2, where all nine `waitUntil` call sites
   in `EventDrivenTestClockSelfTests` recorded a 30 s timeout while every
   downstream assertion in those same tests passed — including two 50 ms hang
   guards that would each have recorded a second issue had the handshake
   genuinely been missing. **That contrast is the triage rule**: when a
   handshake genuinely misses, the assertions after it fail too; when only the
   wait fails and the rest of the test passes, the wait is lying.)

Full rationale: `docs/specs/2026-07-24-test-hardening-design.md` §6.

## `@MainActor` tests: suspend to drain, never pump

A `@MainActor` test body **is** a block executing on the serial main queue, and in
this test process that queue is drained by libdispatch's own main-thread drain,
not by CFRunLoop. So for as long as the body runs synchronously, nothing else on
that queue runs — including the deferred work the body is trying to observe.

**Never spin a nested run loop to wait for something.** A nested
`RunLoop.current.run(until:)` cannot re-enter the main queue, so it drains none
of it. Three things were measured here — each against a loop kept alive by an
attached timer, so it genuinely spun for its full duration rather than returning
early — and all three hold both bare and after `NSApplication.shared` exists: a
block enqueued with `DispatchQueue.main.async` immediately before a 0.3 s nested
run loop had **still not run** when the loop returned; a suspended `@MainActor`
task was **not** resumed by it; and neither was a task parked on a continuation
resumed from a background queue — the shape a test awaiting a bounded-poll
helper has.

**Suspending is the only thing that returns the queue.** `await Task.yield()`
hands the main actor back, the queued block runs, and only then does the
continuation resume — so the test observes the effect it came to assert.

Two shapes, and they are not interchangeable.
`TableTranscriptHarness.drainMainQueue()` is the minimal one — a few bare
`Task.yield()`s, no condition and no sleep. That is enough when the work is
already on the queue and handing it back is all that was missing, but it checks
nothing and so **carries no failure signal**: if the work needs longer than the
yields it gets, the test proceeds as though it arrived. Use it only where the
work is certainly enqueued. When you are waiting on something that may never
arrive — a decode, a file read — poll instead (assertion-hygiene rule 3 above):
`Task.sleep` between checks of a done condition, against an iteration cap, so a
no-show fails an assertion rather than passing quietly.
`TranscriptImageAttachmentTests.pump(_:until:)` is that shape.

This does not contradict the warning under "Clock and date seams" below that
spinning `Task.yield()` **does not converge**. The two describe opposite
situations. There, the waiter needs *scheduling progress somewhere else* before
it can proceed, and yielding does not produce it — that section owns the
queueing mechanics and the measurement behind them. Here the work is already
enqueued on the queue this body is holding, so releasing that queue is the
entire remedy, and the surrounding loop exists only to bound how long you wait
for a decode that may never arrive. **Yield to release something you hold;
never to hurry something you don't.**

**The failure shape is why this rule is written down.** The deferred work does
not vanish; it runs once the body ends, inside whatever test is running by then.
So the offending test **passes in isolation** and reds a *sibling* — the reported
failure names innocent code. Shared process-wide state makes it concrete: a
block that repopulates `TranscriptImageService.shared` after another test called
`clearCaches()` corrupts that test, not its own. **`.serialized` does not help**,
because it orders test *bodies* and this work escaped one.

**What a nested run loop legitimately does** is run-loop-scheduled work only:
`NSTimer`, `CFRunLoopSource`, AppKit display and layout. Driving those from a
synchronous body is its one honest use, and the two `pump()` helpers in
`Tests/TBDAppTests` exist for it. It is never a synchronization primitive for
`DispatchQueue.main.async` or Swift concurrency — if a helper's docstring claims
to "drain" either, the claim is false.

**And it can be a silent no-op.** `run(until:)` returns immediately when no
input source or timer is attached to the loop — measured 0.000 s bare against
0.321 s once a timer was added. A pump that appears to be doing something may be
doing nothing at all, at either end of the range.

The compiler already closes the worst half. `NSRunLoop.h` annotates every
spinning method — `run`, `run(until:)`, `run(_:before:)`,
`acceptInput(for:before:)` — plus the `current` property itself with
`NS_SWIFT_UNAVAILABLE_FROM_ASYNC`; `main` is deliberately not annotated, so the
methods are the enforcement point and `RunLoop.main.run(until:)` is refused
just the same. A nested loop can therefore only appear in a synchronous body or
helper — exactly the context that can never suspend.
**Reaching for one from an `async` test and finding it won't compile is the
signal to yield, not to hoist the spin into a sync helper.**

There is no lint rule for this, deliberately, and for the same reason rule 4
above has none: nothing mechanical can tell "drive AppKit layout" from "wait for
a callback" at a `RunLoop.run` call site. A rule banning the syntax would fire
on both, would start life fully suppressed against the legitimate sites, and
would be one people disable.

## Clock and date seams

Governing rule: **`Duration` is behavior, `Date` is data.** The two seams are
not interchangeable — picking the wrong one is how a test ends up measuring
elapsed wall time on a loaded runner instead of asserting behavior.

### Behavior — delays, debounces, timers, polling intervals, timeouts

```swift
init(..., clock: any Clock<Duration> = ContinuousClock())
```

Last initializer parameter, named `clock`, defaulted so no call site changes
and the migration is behavior-preserving by construction. **Existential, not
generic**, and not named `scheduler`: these subsystems are actors carrying
`Sendable` conformances, and a generic parameter would infect their types.

Tests pass `TestClock` and drive time with `advanceWhenSuspended(by:)`, which
buys exact virtual timings instead of tolerance windows.

**Where the real sleeps went — the distinction to keep straight.** "No real
sleeps" applies to the *behaviour under test*: it never waits on wall time, so
its assertions are exact and load-independent. It does **not** mean the process
never sleeps. `advanceWhenSuspended` has to observe that the code under test
has actually reached its `sleep`, and that is real task scheduling, not virtual
time — so it polls with a real `Task.sleep` against a deadline (bounded
polling, rule 3 above). Spinning `Task.yield()` there instead does not
converge: it keeps the waiter runnable and re-queues it behind the very task it
is waiting for, and raising the budget makes it worse, not better.

Consequence to design around: clock-driven suites are load-**tolerant**, not
load-**independent**. `TestClock.advance(to:)` calls `Task.megaYield()` twice
per advance inside swift-clocks — 20 background-QoS tasks each — so a large
population of clock-driven tests running in parallel floods the pool with
exactly the low-priority work each one is waiting on, and they starve each
other. If a clock-driven suite fails on the arming handshake, reach for
`@Suite(.serialized)` before reaching for a longer timeout: it narrows that one
suite rather than the target, and measured on the appearance suite it was both
reliable *and* faster.

That advice covers a suite starving **itself**. It does not cover
process-global saturation, where a suite starves on the other 4000 tests — see
"Population is the scheduler" above, where an already-`.serialized` suite still
flaked and the remedy was population, not suite ordering.

**Keep advance chains short — single digits.** If crossing a threshold would
take many production-sized intervals, **inject the pacing values** (that is
what the interval init parameters are for) and cross it in 2–3 advances rather
than 100.

Measured: 100 tight `advanceWhenSuspended` iterations, accumulating a 5 s
threshold out of 50 ms production intervals, passed in **0.626 s unloaded and
hung past 10 minutes under 12 spinners**. The helper was behaving exactly as
specified — it is non-throwing by design, so under load, if the code under test
does not re-park within its yield budget, it records an `Issue` and *continues*;
`advance` then moves `now` with no sleeper registered, and the sleep that
arrives afterwards is scheduled against the new `now` and never fires.
Permanent desync. The defect is emergent, not a helper bug: one advance has a
small miss probability, one hundred makes it near-certain. That is a property
of the *usage*, which is why it is a written rule rather than a helper fix.

**The mechanism is record-and-continue desync**, and naming it says which chains
are exposed. `EventDrivenTestClock`'s strict waits — `requireSleeperArmed`,
`requireAdvanceWhenArmed` — do not share it: a missed arming throws *before*
anything advances, so the chain stops at the first bad step, nothing later runs
against a desynced clock, and the failure is a named diagnostic rather than a
hang. **The rule is not lifted for strict callers.** The majority of
clock-driven suites still use the predecessor helpers, where the warning holds
in full, and both suites on the strict waits already sit inside single digits —
so lifting it would buy nothing and cost a rule that currently holds everywhere.
A future case with a real need can argue it on evidence now that the mechanism
is written down.

**The counter-rule, because following the above naively degrades coverage.**
Shortening a chain silently buys a weaker assertion — and it degrades
invisibly, because the test still passes. One migrated test named for having
"no deadline" ended up running 4 iterations totalling 150 ms virtual and never
reaching the 5 s threshold its own docstring claimed. Whenever you shorten a
chain, check that the test still crosses the thresholds its name and docstring
claim; if it does not, inject pacing sized to span them within the same 3–5
advance budget. Short chain *and* strong claim — you do not have to trade them.

**The failure signature is the part to internalize:** this did not present as a
red test. It presented as a **hang**, and in the stress log as a silently
truncated iteration with no `Test run with N tests` summary line — which a
naive `rc == 0` check counts as a pass. It was caught only because the harness
asserted the executed test count per iteration. **A truncated log or a missing
summary line is a failure, not a pass.** Any harness, corpus runner, or stress
loop must treat "no summary" as red.

**The existential pins `Duration`, not `Instant`** — so it can express delays
but not deadlines:

| Compiles | Does **not** compile (`#ExistentialMemberAccess`) |
|---|---|
| `try await clock.sleep(for: .seconds(1))` | `clock.sleep(until:tolerance:)` |
| `clock.now`, storage in an `actor` | `instant.duration(to:)` |

Write timeout-shaped code duration-relative, as a task-group race:

```swift
group.addTask { try await work() }
group.addTask { try await clock.sleep(for: limit); return nil }
let first = try await group.next()
group.cancelAll()
```

This is also the better *test* shape: "time out after X" is directly
advanceable on a `TestClock`, while "sleep until instant Y" invites `Instant`
arithmetic that drifts back toward wall-clock reasoning. If you hit a case
that genuinely needs `Instant` math, raise it rather than switching the
subsystem to a generic clock parameter.

### Data — timestamps that get persisted or compared

Two shapes, also not interchangeable:

- **One-shot stamp** (`lastUsedAt`, hibernation stamps): a defaulted method
  parameter, `func touchLastUsed(at date: Date = Date())`. Tests pass a
  literal. No clock object needed to stamp a row.
- **Repeated "what time is it now" reads**: `now: @Sendable () -> Date` on the
  type. Tests back it with `TestDateSource`.

### Shared test helpers — `Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`

Don't roll your own test clock wrapper, advance helper, `.timeLimit` default,
or date box. This file is the whole shared surface:

- `@Suite(.fastPassBounded)` — the one suite/test hang guard for the fast
  parallel pass: a four-minute time limit (Swift Testing expresses limits in
  whole minutes, so that is the dial). A hang-catcher, not a perf budget; its
  value is derived from the pass's measured per-test latency, and every
  fast-pass suite that needs a limit takes it unless the limit is itself the
  regression detector.
- `@Suite(.clockDriven)` — the same value under the name a clock-driven suite
  wants at its call site, because there the hang being caught is a `TestClock`
  sleep nobody advances. See "Population is the scheduler" above for the
  triple, its invariant, and the three tier-3 live suites that pin their own
  `.timeLimit` instead because their limit is a regression detector.
- `await clock.advanceWhenSuspended(by:)` — the one you want by default.
- `await clock.waitForSuspension()` — the same wait without advancing.
- `TestDateSource` — a lock-guarded box behind the `now: @Sendable () -> Date`
  seam. Deliberately a class with a lock rather than an actor, because that
  seam is a *synchronous* `() -> Date`.

**The failure mode to design against:** a tier-1 test awaiting a `TestClock`
sleep that nobody advances hangs forever. Two mitigations, use both —
`.clockDriven` on the suite bounds the hang, and `advanceWhenSuspended` turns
"the code under test never armed its timer" from an infinite hang into a named
failure. Convention: **put the advance immediately next to the assertion it
unblocks**, not in a setup block far away.

**`.clockDriven` is not a reliable backstop on its own** — known limitation,
measured: a desynced advance chain hung past 10 minutes with the trait applied
and the then one-minute limit never fired (the hung work most likely sits in a
detached task the time limit cannot cancel). It usually works and is worth
keeping. Do not make it your *only* hang guard: stress harnesses, corpus
runners and fuzzers need an outer timeout of their own.

One caution on those two helpers: they record an `Issue` and continue rather
than throwing, which is safe *only* because neither returns a value. A
non-throwing waiter that does return something — `ControlModeTestSupport.waitFor`
(PR #415) — also keeps going after recording, so anything you index out of its
result must be `#require`-guarded or the test crashes instead of failing
cleanly. Don't generalize "non-throwing" into "no `#require` needed".

**And the crash is the *good* case.** The nastier one is that execution
continues far enough to produce a second, plausible-looking assertion failure
that misattributes the cause. A real instance: a waiter timed out having
collected one event instead of two, the discarded `false` return let the test
carry on, and the visible failure was `[42] == [42, 42]` — which reads as a
generation-numbering bug and sends the reader to the wrong line entirely. A
crash announces itself; this does not. **The tell was the duration**: 62 s for
what should have been a fast assertion failure, i.e. two bounded waits timing
out back to back against the 30 s `ciSafeDeadline` of the day (90 s now, so the
same signature is ~180 s). When an assertion failure took far longer than an
assertion failure should, suspect a swallowed waiter before you believe the
message.

### The event-driven alternative — `Tests/TestSupport/EventDrivenTestClock.swift`

Everything above describes `TestClock` and stays true for its consumers.
Alongside it, `EventDrivenTestClock` exists for suites whose arming handshake has
been **observed** starving under saturation: it signals arming from inside the
same critical section that registers the sleeper, so `advanceWhenArmed(by:)` —
its `advanceWhenSuspended(by:)` — parks on a continuation instead of polling
`checkSuspension()` and its megaYield. The trade to know before choosing it: its
`advance` does **no** yielding, so it never accidentally runs the resumed task's
post-sleep code for you. Positive assertions must await the paired
`FireRecorder.next()`; negative ones read `values` (or `hasSleeper`) and stay
one-sided as they always were — and a negative of the shape "production must
arm no timer here" belongs on `watchForSleeper(on:upTo:)` rather than
`settle()`, because a fixed settle samples once at the end of its window and can
miss an arming that lands late under exactly the load that makes the assertion
worth having.

**Re-arming follows from the same no-yielding property, and it is the sharper
edge.** A task that fires and immediately re-sleeps — any poller loop — cannot
have re-registered by the time `advance` returns, so after a fire the *next*
advance must go through `advanceWhenArmed(by:)`. A bare `advance` moves `now`
past a deadline that is not in the ledger yet; the re-armed sleep is then
measured from the new `now` and never fires, and the suite desyncs permanently —
the same hang described above for `TestClock` under load, except deterministic
rather than probabilistic. It is the first thing to get right when migrating a
poller suite, where every advance past the first is a re-arm.

**Each wait comes in two forms, split like `#expect` / `#require`.**
`sleeperArmed` / `advanceWhenArmed` record a miss and continue;
`requireSleeperArmed` / `requireAdvanceWhenArmed` throw the same
`NoSleeperArmed` diagnostic instead. Prefer the strict pair in anything
chain-shaped — a poller test, where each step is sound only if the previous one
landed — and keep the soft pair for a single-shot wait whose next statement is
an assertion that fails informatively on its own. Both suppress the diagnostic
on *cancellation*: the wait ends, but attribution belongs to whatever cancelled
the test. Design:
`docs/specs/2026-08-13-poller-suite-clock-migration-design.md`.

**And the migration's real work is not the clock swap.** It is replacing
clock-state inference with the observable the test already holds: a poller suite
that asked `checkSuspension()` whether its sleep had ended was reading a
snapshot and relying on that call's internal megaYield to have let the resumed
task run first. `hasSleeper` has no such nudge, so port those to the positive
fact — `FireRecorder.next()` on the effect, or joining the task — rather than to
a weaker negative.

**Count each `FireRecorder.next()` in the
`.clockDriven` tally too**: it carries its own 45 s hang guard, exactly like a
`waitForSuspension`, so a test with 2 `advanceWhenArmed` + 2 `next()` has a
180 s worst case against the 240 s limit. And `next()` is **non-throwing** — it
records and returns `nil` — so it does not stop a chain the way a strict arming
wait does: a `next()` that times out mid-chain leaves every guard after it
payable in the same run. Put it last, which is what makes the poller chains
above cost one guard in practice rather than their paper tally. Either clock is
a legitimate choice for a new clock-driven test. Existing `TestClock` suites
migrate on field evidence, not wholesale — currently `AppearanceDebounceTests`
and `SearchQueryDebouncerTests`,
which reproduced the starvation in a full-suite soak, plus the two poller suites
`GatedIntervalSleepTests` and `DaywatchRunnerLoopTests`, whose chains on the
predecessor helpers each paid five wall-clock guards — 225 s of the 240 s
ceiling, one scheduling excursion from tripping it. Design:
`docs/specs/2026-08-11-event-driven-test-clock-design.md`.

`PollerClock` is **not** this seam and must not be copied as a template — see
its doc comment. Full rationale:
