// Shared clock seams for the test-hardening program
// (`docs/specs/2026-07-24-test-hardening-design.md` §5).
//
// §5's governing rule is **`Duration` is behavior, `Date` is data**: production
// types take `clock: any Clock<Duration> = ContinuousClock()` for delays,
// debounces, timers and deadlines, and a `now: @Sendable () -> Date` (or
// `date: Date = Date()`) parameter for timestamps that get persisted or
// compared. This file is the *only* place those two seams get test-side
// helpers. No slice should roll its own `TestClock` wrapper, advance helper, or
// mutable-clock date source — if something here is missing or wrong, change it
// here so all five consuming slices move together.

    /// **(a) The value is derived from the pass's measured latency, not from
    /// how long the test ought to take.** Swift Testing runs the whole
    /// population in one process with no concurrency cap, on a 3-thread CI
    /// runner, so a test's *reported* duration is mostly time suspended waiting
    /// for a thread. Mined from a green run: fast pass 1 (`^TBDDaemonTests\.`,
    /// ~5200 tests) reported p50 65.6 s, p99 92.1 s, max 95.5 s, with 87% of
    /// tests over 45 s; fast pass 2 (everything else, ~4800 tests) reported p90
    /// 51.4 s and max 55.3 s. A limit of one minute therefore sits **below the
    /// median** of a healthy pass 1 and five seconds above the **maximum** of a
    /// healthy pass 2 — it is a coin flip on green runs, and it fired that way
    /// on three `TerminalLockedAccessTests` tests at the same instant, twice in
    /// five days, with no hang anywhere. Four minutes clears the measured
    /// maximum by ~2.5x while staying a small fraction of the step budget. The
    /// full derivation — how 240 s composes with `ciSafeDeadline` (90 s) and
    /// `waitForSuspension` (45 s), and the invariant the three satisfy together
    /// — is on ``clockDriven`` below; re-derive all of them together when the
    /// population moves materially.
    ///
    /// **(b) The rule: a fast-pass suite uses this trait rather than a literal
    /// `.timeLimit`, unless the limit is itself the regression detector.** A
    /// hang guard asserts nothing and costs a passing run nothing, so there is
    /// no reason for two of them to carry different numbers — a per-suite
    /// literal is a second dial that nobody re-derives when the population
    /// moves, and every one of them in this tree was reasoned from a runtime
    /// measured on an idle machine. The exception is a limit the test *depends*
    /// on: where a child must outlive the limit, or a regressed drain must, the
    /// number is a mutation-verified proof and raising it disarms the proof with
    /// nothing going red. Those live in the tier-3 target, which runs

    /// outlive the limit), `GitManagerTimeoutTests` and `SubprocessTimeoutTests`
    /// (a regressed EOF-waiting drain must outlive it). Don't tidy those to this
    /// trait; do reach for it everywhere else.

    /// The known failure mode of virtual time (§5, "Known failure mode") is
    /// that a tier-1 test awaiting a `TestClock` sleep nobody advances hangs
    /// **forever** — no assertion fails, no output appears, the whole `swift
    /// test` run just stops. That is far worse than a red test, because CI
    /// burns its job timeout and the failure names no suite.
    ///
    /// This bounds it. The value is not a performance budget — it is a
    /// hang-catcher, and Swift Testing expresses time limits in whole minutes,
    /// so the only dial available is an integer count of them. A clock-driven
    /// tier-1 test should still finish in milliseconds; if it takes minutes, it
    /// is wedged, and you want the failure attributed to the test rather than
    /// to the runner.
    ///
    /// **Why 4 and no longer 1.** The floor argument (whole minutes) says the
    /// limit cannot be *smaller* than a minute; it never argued that one minute
    /// was right. What pins the value from below are the two wall-clock waits a
    /// clock-driven test can sit on: this file's `waitForSuspension` (45 s,
    /// re-derived below) and `ciSafeDeadline` (90 s,
    /// `Tests/TBDDaemonTests/ControlModeTestSupport.swift`). Clock-driven
    /// suites really do consume the latter — `AttachRPCOrchestrationTests` and
    /// `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests` are both `.clockDriven, .serialized` and
    /// between them hold 44 `waitFor` call sites — so the two values race and
    /// must be derived together.
    ///
    /// The invariant is **not** "every chained wait in a test fits inside this
    /// limit". `waitFor` is non-throwing on timeout, so chains are real, and the
    /// deepest is 6 waits in one `PaneRepairCoordinator` test — unsatisfiable
    /// then (6 x 30 s vs `.minutes(1)`) and unsatisfiable now. The invariant is:
    /// **this limit must afford the first full deadline plus the rest of an
    /// ordinary test.** The first timeout's `Issue.record` fires immediately
    /// with its named diagnostic, so it survives even if this limit later
    /// truncates the test; chains beyond the first belong to a test that is
    /// already failing, and truncating those is deliberate.
    ///
    /// 4 minutes = 240 s satisfies that:
    /// - one `waitFor` (90 s) + one `waitForSuspension` (45 s) = 135 s ✓
    /// - two `waitFor` = 180 s ✓
    /// - two `waitForSuspension` = 90 s ✓ — this keeps the original "a test that
    ///   waits twice must afford both waits" property the one-minute pairing
    ///   was reasoned from
    ///
    /// 240 s stays far above any legitimate clock-driven run, which finishes in
    /// milliseconds.
    ///
    /// **The margin is thin, and it is worth naming how thin.** Do not read
    /// "240 s" as comfortable headroom — several existing chains sit near or
    /// past it, all consistent with the invariant (only an already-failing test
    /// ever pays a full chain of timeouts), but with nothing to spare:
    /// Count `advanceWhenSuspended` as a `waitForSuspension` when you tally a
    /// chain — it *calls* one before advancing, so it pays the full guard —
    /// and count each `EventDrivenTestClock.FireRecorder.next()` the same way.
    /// Grepping only for the literal `waitForSuspension(` undercounts every
    /// figure below, which is how a PR #547 reviewer read two of these chains
    /// as shallower than they are.
    /// - `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests.readerWaitEscalatesToTheSlowInterval` is
    ///   the deepest chain still riding this type's **non-throwing** pair: four
    ///   `advanceWhenSuspended` plus one `waitForSuspension`, five clock guards
    ///   for 225 s, and its two `waitFor` calls take the paper worst case to
    ///   405 s. Every guard there is payable in one run, because a miss records
    ///   and the chain keeps going.
    /// - The poller chains are nominally deeper still —
    ///   `GatedIntervalSleepTests.returnsAfterExpectedPollCount` pays six
    ///   guards (3 `requireAdvanceWhenArmed` + 2 `requireSleeperArmed` + 1
    ///   `FireRecorder.next()`) for 270 s, past this limit;
    ///   `GatedIntervalSleepTests.boundaryIsExact` and
    ///   `DaywatchRunnerLoopTests.testSubsequentTicksAtInterval` pay five for
    ///   225 s — but they are on `EventDrivenTestClock`'s strict waits, where a
    ///   missed arming throws before anything advances, so the chain stops at
    ///   the first bad step. Their one non-throwing guard, `next()`, sits last
    ///   with nothing behind it to inherit the run, so at most one 45 s guard
    ///   elapses in any single run and 270 s describes a run that cannot
    ///   happen (see "The event-driven alternative" below).
    /// - In `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests`, **6 of 13** tests have a worst case
    ///   above 240 s (counting `waitFor` at 90 s and each clock wait at 45 s),
    ///   not just the one 6-deep chain (540 s) usually cited. Four of the sites
    ///   that used to push that count to 9 of 13 are now single `advanceUntil`
    ///   guards instead of an advance plus a 90 s `waitFor`.
    ///
    /// **If these start tripping, shorten the chain — do not raise this limit
    /// again.** `Tests/CLAUDE.md` already requires advance chains to stay in
    /// single digits, and a 5-deep chain is at the edge of that rule; injecting
    /// pacing values to cross a threshold in 2–3 advances is the remedy. Raising
    /// 240 s buys room for chains that only an already-failing test walks, and
    /// costs every genuinely wedged test that much longer to be attributed.
    ///
    /// **Scope: this is sized for the fast parallel pass.** Every input above —
    /// the ~4536-test population, the arming latency it inflates, the two
    /// wall-clock waits it makes expensive — is a property of the in-process
    /// parallel run. Tier-3 suites in `Tests/TBDDaemonLiveTests` execute in the
    /// quiet pass (`--filter '^TBDDaemonLiveTests\.' --no-parallel`, idle
    /// machine), where arming latency is milliseconds and none of that applies.
    ///
    /// So a tier-3 suite whose time limit is its **regression detector** rather
    /// than a hang guard must pin its own `.timeLimit` instead of inheriting
    /// this one — a raise here would silently disarm the proof, with nothing
    /// going red to say so. Precedent, all pinned to `.timeLimit(.minutes(1))`
    /// with the reasoning in their suite docs:
    /// `SubprocessTimeoutStarvationTests` (a `sleep 90` child must outlive the
    /// limit), `GitManagerTimeoutTests` and `SubprocessTimeoutTests` (a
    /// regressed EOF-waiting drain must outlive it). Don't widen those to
    /// `.clockDriven` for consistency's sake.
    ///
    /// **It is ``fastPassBounded`` under another name, and deliberately so.**
    /// Everything derived above is a property of the fast parallel pass rather
    /// than of virtual time, so a clock-driven suite and a suite that merely
    /// waits on a subprocess want the same number; keeping one dial is what

    /// Where the **number** of advances is itself the property under test.

    /// as the code re-arms, which would dissolve that proof. Use the explicit
    /// `advanceWhenSuspended` pair there.
    ///
    /// **And — the sharper limit — where the loop under test re-arms under a
    /// saturated fast pass, because this helper starves the re-arm it is
    /// waiting for.** Each turn probes `isArmed()`, which is
    /// `checkSuspension()`, which opens with a `megaYield`: twenty
    /// serially-awaited **background-QoS** tasks. At a 25 ms poll interval that
    /// is ~1,800 probes and ~36,000 background tasks over the 45 s budget,
    /// queued on the same cooperative pool the poller needs a turn from. The
    /// field signature is this helper's own diagnostic
    /// reading **"observed 1 clock advance"**: the first tick landed and the
    /// re-arm after it was never seen. On 2026-09-08 that reddened
    /// `ModelProxySupervisorTests` on three consecutive CI dispatches of one
    /// SHA, over 45–170 s, with nothing wrong with the supervisor.

    /// ## Why this polls with a real sleep instead of yielding
    ///
    /// This waiter used to spin `await Task.yield()` up to a fixed budget of 20.

    /// failed. The contrast that identifies the variable: the same six tests are
    /// 6/6 green under `--filter AppearanceDebounceTests`, 10/10 green under a
    /// 24-test filter, and 0/3 in the full target *at the same machine load*. So
    /// the failure scales with the number of runnable tasks in the process, not
    /// with CPU load.
    ///
    /// The reason is what `Task.yield()` actually does: it keeps the calling task
    /// **runnable** and re-enqueues it behind every other runnable task in the
    /// process. In a large parallel target that queue is thousands deep, so the
    /// waiter spends its whole budget cycling through the back of the queue while
    /// the one task it is waiting for — the code under test, on its way to its
    /// `sleep` — never gets a turn. Spinning harder enqueues more work and starves
    /// it further, which is exactly the 577 s result.
    ///
    /// A real `Task.sleep` inverts that: it makes this task **non-runnable** and
    /// hands the executor back, so the runtime schedules the code under test
    /// normally instead of making it win a race against our own spin loop.
    ///
    /// This is bounded polling with a deadline — sanctioned by `Tests/CLAUDE.md`
    /// assertion-hygiene rule 3 — and it is *not* a wall-clock assertion. What is

    /// exact. The timeout is a hang-catcher, in the same family as `.clockDriven`,
    /// not a timing budget.
    ///
    /// ## What this does NOT fix
    ///
    /// `checkSuspension()` opens with `Task.megaYield()` — 20 serially-awaited
    /// **background-QoS** detached tasks — and `TestClock.advance(to:)` calls it
    /// twice more per advance. That is inside swift-clocks, on the hot path of
    /// every clock-driven test, and no change here can remove it. macOS starves
    /// background QoS under saturation, so a residual load sensitivity remains:
    /// this is load-*tolerant*, not load-*independent*. Measured healthy-path
    /// cost is tens of microseconds to a few milliseconds, but a 6-test suite was
    /// observed taking 8.4 s instead of 0.05 s — green, visibly stuck behind a
    /// slow megaYield — at load average >= 200 on 12 cores. CI (3–4 cores, `-j 2`,
    /// otherwise idle) is far from that regime. Making this load-independent
    /// means a megaYield-free virtual clock replacing `TestClock`, which is a
    /// shared-contract change and deliberately not bundled here.
    ///
    /// Lowering the megaYield count is **refuted** as a remedy at CI's regime,
    /// and this closes the open question in issue #496. `TASK_MEGA_YIELD_COUNT=1`
    /// was measured against an unset baseline across interleaved runs under
    /// induced load, population held constant: p90 26.5 s / 31.2 s -> 26.0 s /
    /// 29.4 s, p99 26.6 s -> 27.0 s. That is noise. The megaYield is a real but
    /// **secondary** contributor; the dominant term is the number of runnable
    /// tasks in the process (see the population note on `timeout` below), which
    /// is why CI shards the fast pass in two rather than tuning this knob.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - timeout: hang guard, and the value is a two-sided constraint. It must

    ///     than tripping the suite limit first and reporting an uninformative
    ///     "wedged". But it must also clear the worst-case real arming latency:
    ///     at 5 s, the appearance suite failed 4 of 6 full-target runs on this

    ///
    ///     The pair is therefore derived together, and 15 s / `.minutes(1)` was

    ///     process-wide runnable-task count, not with the suite under test —
    ///     mined CI runs show p50 per-test reported duration at ~1/3 of total
    ///     wall time even on green runs, i.e. tests spend most of their
    ///     "duration" suspended waiting for a turn.
    ///
    ///     Re-derived for the current population: 45 s here, so a twice-waiting
    ///     test needs 90 s, inside `.clockDriven`'s 4-minute (240 s) limit with
    ///     room for the rest of the test — and 45 s plus one 90 s
    ///     `ciSafeDeadline` wait is 135 s, also inside it. See `.clockDriven`
    ///     above for the full triple and the invariant that licenses it. Only a
    ///     genuinely un-armed timer ever pays this timeout — a healthy handshake
    ///     returns in milliseconds, so the raise costs passing runs nothing.
    ///
    ///     What 45 s does **not** buy is a deep chain: at five of these waits
    ///     a test is at 225 s of a 240 s limit, and this helper's non-throwing
    ///     shape means a chain that size pays every guard rather than stopping
    ///     at the first miss (contrast `EventDrivenTestClock`'s strict pair,
    ///     `requireSleeperArmed` / `requireAdvanceWhenArmed`, under "The
    ///     event-driven alternative" below, where a miss throws immediately).
    ///     ("Fast pass", not "live": tier-3 `TBDDaemonLiveTests` pins its own
    ///     limit and is unaffected.) That is
    ///     consistent with the invariant — only a failing test walks the whole
    ///     chain — but it is not headroom. The remedy if it bites is to shorten
    ///     the chain (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`: keep advances in single digits; inject
    ///     pacing), not to raise 240 s. Re-derive all three numbers again if the
    ///     population moves materially.
    ///   - pollInterval: how long to step aside between probes. Each probe costs
    ///     a megaYield, so probing tightly floods the pool with background tasks
    ///     and starves the very task being waited for — lazier is better.

    /// are real wall-clock quantities for the scheduling handshake, deliberately
