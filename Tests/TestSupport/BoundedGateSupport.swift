// Thread-blocking gates in tests, and the two things they need to be safe.
//
// Several suites hold a piece of production work still at a chosen instant —
// freeze a date provider on its first call, hold a receive loop mid-loop, hold
// a teardown mid-stop — while the test observes the world around it. The seam
// they reach is a *synchronous* closure, so the only way to hold it is to
// block the thread running it: `DispatchSemaphore.wait()`, released by the
// test.
//
// WHICH THREAD gets blocked is the whole safety question, and it is decided by
// the caller, not by the gate.
//
// ## 1. Never block a cooperative-pool thread — `gateHoldingTask`
//
// A blocked thread is gone until the gate is released. When that thread
// belongs to Swift's cooperative pool the loss is shared: the pool is only as
// wide as the machine has cores (CI's `macos-26-arm64` runner has 3), every
// suspended task in the process needs a thread from it, and the statement that
// would release the gate is itself async work needing one. Park as many gates
// as the pool is wide and no thread can reach any `signal()`; the process
// stops making progress permanently.
//
// That is not hypothetical: it turned `main` red. All ~4050 tests run in one
// process with no concurrency cap, and on the 3-thread runner the pass went
// silent for ~23 minutes and died on the step's 30-minute `timeout-minutes`
// having reported zero test failures. No per-test `.timeLimit` fired either —
// a blocked thread is exactly where cooperative cancellation cannot reach.
//
// Bounding the wait does not fix that. A bounded wait still owns its thread
// for the whole deadline, so the gates stop wedging the process and instead
// starve it: on the first bounded run the four date-seam suites held pool
// threads for their full 120 s while ~43 innocent tests in suites with no gate
// of their own blew their own 90 s and 120 s hang-catchers. The cure is to
// keep the blocking OFF the pool entirely — start the task that will hold a
// gate with `gateHoldingTask`, which pins it (and every default-actor hop it
// makes) to threads these tests own.
//
// Gates reached from a dedicated `Thread` never had the problem and need
// nothing: `FDVendingServer` delivers to its sinks from a dedicated receive
// thread. `WorktreeDeletionQueue` and `TmuxControlSupervisor` reach their gates
// from dispatch queues, which keeps them off the cooperative pool but does NOT
// give them dedicated threads. Their small fixed counts keep a plain bounded
// `waitForGate`; the executor below cannot share libdispatch workers with them,
// because many simultaneous gate tasks can consume every such worker.
//
// ## 2. Bound every wait anyway — `waitForGate`
//
// The bound is the safety net under the rule above, not a substitute for it.
// An author who adds a gate and starts it with a plain `Task` gets a named
// failing test naming the gate instead of an anonymous 30-minute job timeout —
// the same reason `test.yml`'s own `timeout-minutes` comment gives for
// existing. Every gate in this repo goes through `waitForGate` so there is one
// seam to find and one deadline to re-derive.

/// Runs jobs on threads the test process owns rather than on Swift's
/// cooperative pool, so a task that blocks inside a gate cannot starve
/// unrelated tests.
///
/// Task executor preference is inherited by child tasks and — per SE-0417 —
/// also carries into *default* actors, so a handler that hops through
/// `RPCRouter`, a store actor and `CodexTranscriptActivityTracker` keeps
/// running here for the whole call. TBD declares no custom `unownedExecutor`
/// anywhere in `Sources/`, so there is no actor along these paths that would
/// pull the job back onto the pool.
///
/// Every enqueued task job gets a real `Thread`, not a concurrent dispatch
/// queue. Dispatch queues do not own threads; enough blocking jobs on one can
/// consume libdispatch's workers and starve unrelated queue work. A task job is
/// one synchronous continuation: its thread exits when that continuation
/// completes or suspends, and the next continuation gets another thread. Gate
/// tasks follow finite test-only RPC paths, so this bounded resumption churn is
/// preferable to sharing either of the process-wide worker pools they test.

/// work the test runs while the gate is closed, and the `signal()` that
/// releases it — stays on the pool, which is the point: it needs a thread,
/// and this call is what guarantees one is left.
///
/// **That assumes the pool can be reached.** When a suite shares the test
/// process with one that deliberately saturates the pool —
/// `BoundedGateWaitTests`'s whole subject, which parks every cooperative
/// thread for 120 s — a releasing side left on the pool may not run at all,
/// and the hand-off that releases the gate needs `gateHoldingTask` too, not
/// just the held side. `ModelProxySupervisorTests.swift`'s `runBlocking` is
/// the sanctioned pattern for that case: both the held side and the
/// `signal()`-equivalent hand-off run through `gateHoldingTask`, and its own
/// doc comment explains why.
///
/// **The preference stops at an unstructured task.** SE-0417 carries a task
/// executor preference into child tasks (`async let`, task groups) and into
/// default actors, and *not* into `Task {}` or `Task.detached`. So this call
/// covers the operation's own frames and the actors it hops through, but not
/// work a callee hands to an unstructured task — `ShutdownLatch` does exactly
/// that, deliberately, so a cancelled signal handler cannot abandon a shutdown
/// other callers are awaiting. Work beyond such a hop is scheduled on the
/// cooperative pool however its caller was started, so a gate released from
/// there is subject to the pass's scheduling latency and must be bounded by
/// ``TestDeadlines/saturatedPass`` rather than by a snappier number. It is not
/// pinning a thread, and no call-site change can move it. What can move it is
/// the callee taking the executor itself: `ShutdownLatch(executor:)` exists
/// for tests that hold a latch of their own, and `ServerShutdownLatchTests`
/// builds one on `GateExecutor.shared` so nothing it waits on touches the
/// pool. A test that reaches a latch through a server's `stop()` has no such
/// handle — the servers build their latches with the default — so there the
/// bound is still the only thing yours to get right. `BoundedGateWaitTests`
