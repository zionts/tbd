// A megaYield-free virtual clock, plus the awaitable recorder that goes with it.
//
// Design and rationale:
// `docs/specs/2026-08-11-event-driven-test-clock-design.md`.
//
// The short version, because it explains every API choice below. `TestClock`
// (swift-clocks) makes a clock-driven suite load-*tolerant*, not
// load-*independent*, and both halves of its test<->clock handshake are the
// reason:
//
// - **Arming is polled.** The only way to observe "a sleeper is registered" on
//   a `TestClock` is `checkSuspension()`, which opens with `Task.megaYield()` —
//   20 serially-awaited background-QoS detached tasks per probe. Under
//   process-global saturation macOS starves background QoS, so the probe both
//   fails to see the arming *and* floods the pool with more of exactly the work
//   that is starving. Field signature: `Issue recorded` at the
//   `advanceWhenSuspended` call site, then an empty fired-values array.
// - **Firing is asserted synchronously.** `TestClock.advance(to:)` megaYields
//   after finishing a sleeper's continuation, which is the only thing that
//   *usually* lets the resumed task run its post-sleep code before `advance`
//   returns. That is a scheduling accident, not a guarantee.
//
// This file makes both directions event-driven. `EventDrivenTestClock` signals
// arming from inside the same critical section that registers the sleeper, and
// `FireRecorder` turns "the effect happened" into something a test can await
// instead of guess at. Under arbitrary load a green test here gets slower,
// never red.
//
// This is an *addition*, not a replacement: `TestClock` and
// `ClockTestSupport`'s `advanceWhenSuspended` / `waitForSuspension` stay for
// their existing consumers, and suites migrate on field evidence rather than
// wholesale.

// MARK: - EventDrivenTestClock

/// A deterministic virtual clock whose arming handshake is a signal, not a poll.
///
/// Drop-in for `TestClock` in a tier-1 suite: it conforms to
/// `Clock` with `Duration == Swift.Duration`, so it satisfies the production
/// `clock: any Clock<Duration>` seam unchanged. The differences are the two that
/// matter under load:
///
/// - `advanceWhenArmed(by:)` replaces `advanceWhenSuspended(by:)`. It parks on a
///   continuation that the *clock itself* resumes when a sleeper registers, so
///   there is no probe, no megaYield and no busy budget to exhaust.
/// - `advance(by:)` performs **no** yielding of any kind. It moves virtual time
///   and resumes due sleepers, and that is all — so a test must await
///   ``FireRecorder/next(timeout:sourceLocation:)`` for any *positive*
///   assertion about what a resumed task did. See `advance(to:)`.
///
/// Each wait comes in two forms, split like Swift Testing's `#expect` /
/// `#require`: ``sleeperArmed(timeout:sourceLocation:)`` and
/// ``advanceWhenArmed(by:sourceLocation:)`` record a miss and continue, while
/// ``requireSleeperArmed(timeout:sourceLocation:)`` and
/// ``requireAdvanceWhenArmed(by:sourceLocation:)`` throw. Prefer the strict pair
/// in anything shaped like a chain — a poller test, where every step's
/// correctness depends on the previous one having landed.
///
/// The correctness property worth stating explicitly, because it is why this is
/// a clock rather than a wrapper around `TestClock`: the arming signal is
/// emitted **after** the suspension has been appended to the ledger, under the
/// same lock. A waiter can therefore never be released into a world where the
/// sleeper it was told about is not yet registered — which is exactly the gap
/// that makes a signalling *wrapper* around `TestClock` unsound, since that
/// registration happens inside `TestClock`'s own lock where no wrapper can
/// interpose.
///
/// Usage:
///
/// ```swift
/// let clock = EventDrivenTestClock()
/// let fired = FireRecorder<String>()
/// let debouncer = SearchQueryDebouncer(interval: .milliseconds(250), clock: clock)
///
/// debouncer.schedule("wolv") { fired.record($0) }
/// await clock.advanceWhenArmed(by: .milliseconds(250))
/// #expect(await fired.next() == "wolv")
/// ```

/// Shared by the suites on ``EventDrivenTestClock`` because its ``advance`` does
/// no yielding: where `TestClock.advance`'s trailing megaYield supplied this
/// settling incidentally, here it is explicit and bounded. From a `@MainActor`
/// test body this is what returns the main queue, which is the only way the
/// deferred work becomes observable at all (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`, "`@MainActor`
/// tests: suspend to drain, never pump").
///
/// **One-sided, and only ever worth this much:** it proves absence up to the
/// settle window and no further, so a pathologically late fire can make a
/// negative assertion false-*pass*, never false-fail. That is unchanged from
/// the synchronous read it replaces. Every *positive* assertion must still go
/// through ``FireRecorder/next(timeout:sourceLocation:)``, which waits for the
/// effect instead of hoping it arrived.

/// Watches for a sleeper to appear on `clock`, for a **negative** assertion of
/// the shape "the code under test must arm no timer at all".
///
/// Why this rather than ``settle()`` there. Arming takes a scheduling turn, so
/// the thing being ruled out cannot appear instantly — and a fixed settle
/// window buys its whole proof at one instant at the end of that window. Under
/// saturation the turn can land later than the window, and the negative passes
/// against production that *did* arm a timer: the assertion stops
/// discriminating exactly when the machine is busy, which is when it matters.
/// Watching instead keeps looking, so the window is a patience budget rather
/// than a single sample, and a regression is caught the moment it shows up
/// instead of only if it happens to show up early.
///
/// **Still one-sided, in the same direction as everything else here.** Absence
/// is proven only up to `window` — a pathologically late arming can make this
/// false-*pass*, never false-fail. Presence, by contrast, is detected the
/// instant it happens, which is what makes the failing direction prompt: the
/// caller learns within one poll interval rather than after the full window.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - clock: the clock whose ledger is watched.
///   - window: how long to keep watching before concluding absence. A second is
///     ~100× the scheduling turn being ruled out, and a passing test pays it
///     only when the code under test is behaving.
/// - Returns: `true` if a sleeper appeared (assert `false` on this), `false` if
///   none appeared within `window`.
