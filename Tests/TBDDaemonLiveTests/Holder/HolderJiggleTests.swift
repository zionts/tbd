/// The jiggle, measured from inside the job it is supposed to reach.
///
/// A reader taking over a session inherits an emulator that knows nothing of
/// what the job has already drawn. The jiggle is how a full-screen program is
/// asked to draw it again: grow the tty by one column, let the job be
/// scheduled, put the column back. Two `SIGWINCH`es, no net size change.
///
/// What it can and cannot do was measured rather than assumed
/// (`docs/specs/2026-09-01-holder-repaint-measurement.md`): an alt-screen
/// program repaints its entire viewport and none of its scrollback, and a plain
/// shell prompt repaints essentially nothing. The jiggle heals screen state; it
/// cannot recover history, which is why the snapshot preamble exists alongside
/// it and not instead of it.
///
/// Two properties are separable and both are asserted, because a jiggle can
/// fail in either direction:
///
///   - The job must observe the **grown** size. Signals do not queue, so two
///     `TIOCSWINSZ` calls with no scheduling gap between them can be collapsed
///     into a single handler run that reads the final, unchanged size — a
///     jiggle that costs an ioctl and repaints nothing.
///   - The job must be left at the size it started at, on the **tty**, which is
///     the only authority on its geometry. The emulator's grid is not evidence
///     of that: the jiggle deliberately never touches it, so a jiggle that
///     forgot to restore the tty would leave `gridSize` looking perfect.
///
/// **Tier 3.** A real `TBDHolder`, a real pty, and a real interpreter as the
/// job.
