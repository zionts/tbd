/// Taking a session back from a viewer: the mirror of the attach, and the
/// reason a closed tab does not brick its session.
///
/// **What was broken before this existed.** `viewerAttachments` was written by
/// `confirmAttach` and cleared by nothing except `release`. So a viewer that
/// went away left a claim behind: `adopt` refused on it, `beginAttach` refused
/// on it, and the injection courier read it as "a viewer holds this pty" — so
/// the session was undrained, unwritable and un-reattachable for the daemon's
/// whole life. A job that exits with unread output cannot even finish exiting.
/// Every test here is about that claim being released, and about what has to be
/// true before it is.
///
/// **The handback is O(1) per reader change, not per byte** — it is not the
/// rejected streaming design. Without it a detach from a plain shell leaves the
/// daemon's model frozen at the instant the viewer arrived, because the jiggle
/// heals only programs that repaint and a shell repaints essentially nothing.
///
/// **`reader(for:) == nil` is not the instrument for "the daemon is off the
/// pty", and this suite does not use it as one.** An attach suspends the
/// daemon's reader and retains it — the emulator is the session's only screen
/// while a viewer holds the descriptor, and the only source of the child's
/// modes — so an attached session has a reader and is not being read. The
/// honest instrument is `isDraining`, which reads the drain thread's own flag.
///
