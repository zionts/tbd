/// What a holder-backed job inherits from the daemon that started it, measured
/// from inside the job.
///
/// The defect these were written against: the daemon `posix_spawn`s a holder
/// from a Swift-concurrency worker thread, which runs with nearly every signal
/// blocked, and **a signal mask survives `fork` and `execve` unchanged**. So the
/// job at the end of that chain could not be interrupted, suspended, hung up on,
/// terminated by anything but `SIGKILL`, or told its terminal had changed size.
/// The last of those is the one a user sees: a full-screen TUI never relayouts,
/// and "the jiggle" in
/// `docs/specs/2026-08-30-pty-holder-session-transport-design.md` — a forced
/// `SIGWINCH` that makes such a program repaint into an incoming reader's
/// emulator — silently does nothing.
///
/// Dispositions are a separate inheritance from the mask and are covered by
/// their own line in `Holder.spawnChild`; these tests are about the mask.
///
/// **Tier 3.** Each test spawns a real `TBDHolder` through the real
/// `HolderSpawner`, and the job is a real interpreter on a real pty.
