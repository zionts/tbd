/// Who issues `TIOCSWINSZ` for a holder-backed session, and what the daemon
/// still owes its own emulator when it is not the one issuing it.
///
/// **While a viewer holds the pty, the viewer owns the tty's size.** It has a
/// writable duplicate of the master and sets the size on it directly, so a
/// daemon that also issued the ioctl would signal the child twice for one
/// resize, and — in the window where the two disagree — signal it to a size
/// nobody is painting at. While no viewer holds it the daemon owns both halves,
/// because nothing else can.
///
/// **The grid is not the other half of that trade.** The daemon's emulator is
/// what a re-adoption and `terminal.output` render, and a grid left at the size
/// the viewer arrived at wraps every later line at the wrong width. It is the
/// same defect the adoption path was fixed for once already — a job laying out
/// 123 columns into an 80-column grid — approached from the opposite direction,
/// so it tracks the viewer whether or not the daemon touched the tty.
///
/// The attached state used here is an attach that was vended and never
/// acknowledged. The routing is the same on a confirmed attach — that reader is
/// retained and suspended too — and this state is chosen because it is reached
/// without a viewer standing in: the timed-out attach, where the viewer may
/// already be live on its duplicate and the daemon is deliberately kept off the
/// pty.
///
/// **Tier 3.** A real `TBDHolder`, a real pty, and a real job.
