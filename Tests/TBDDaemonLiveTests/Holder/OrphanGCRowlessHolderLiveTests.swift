/// The row-less holder sweep against **real holder processes**.
///
/// Three cases, and the whole safety argument rests on them being three rather
/// than one. Each spawns a genuine `TBDHolder` through the real `HolderSpawner`,
/// forked onto a real pty, and then reads the kernel's view of the result:
///
///   - a holder this installation owns, past the grace window, claimed by no
///     session row → the child **and** the holder are gone;
///   - the same holder with a different owner token in the `config` row → still
///     running, because a completed handshake proves liveness, not ownership;
///   - the same holder with the *same* owner token but its one client slot
///     already taken → still running, because a rejected connection is terminal
///     in both directions.
///
/// The last two are what make the first one safe to ship. Nothing in an
/// injected-handshake test can prove a real holder refuses a real second client,
/// nor that a real `SIGKILL` reached a real process group.
///
/// **Tier 3**, and serialized: it spawns processes, waits on bounded deadlines,
/// and would not survive the parallel pass.
