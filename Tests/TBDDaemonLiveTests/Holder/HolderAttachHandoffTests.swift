/// Handing one session's pty from the daemon to a viewer, and the rule that

/// each `read` takes bytes the other will never see, and nothing anywhere
/// reports it — so every failure here fails toward *nobody* reading. That is
/// not free: a job that exits with unread output cannot finish exiting, so a
/// no-reader window holds jobs open. It is still the right direction, because
/// an absent reader delays and a double reader corrupts.
///
/// The consequence, which most of this suite exists to pin: **the daemon stops
/// reading when it hands the descriptor over, not when the viewer says thank
/// you.** From the moment the `dup` leaves the daemon the viewer may be on it.
/// What the acknowledgement decides is ownership — whether the daemon still
/// holds a reader it could be put back on — and the two cancellations differ in
/// exactly one respect: whether the viewer can possibly have the descriptor.

/// is in the snapshot, everything after it is still queued on the tty for the
