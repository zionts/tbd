/// Tier 3: every test spawns real children and races a deadline to drive them,
/// which is the tier-3 definition in `Tests/CLAUDE.md`. `ProviderEventsSupervisorTests`
/// — the supervisor this one is modelled on, sharing its generation-guarded
/// teardown, its backoff and its process-group kill — sits in this target for
/// the same reason.
///
/// The stubs are real `bash` children: a duplex NDJSON stream over two real
/// pipes is the thing under test, and a fake would test the fake. Everything
/// that *waits* is on the injected `TestClock` — backoff, the keepalive cadence,
/// the silence watchdog and the SIGTERM→SIGKILL grace — so no test here waits
/// out a production interval in real time.
///
/// **Advancing that clock is what makes the suite tier 3, not the waiting.**
/// `advanceVirtualTime` cannot bind to an event, because `TestClock` publishes
/// no "a sleeper armed" notification: each step has to *poll* `checkSuspension()`,
/// and each poll pays a `megaYield` that re-enqueues the caller behind every
/// runnable task in the process (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`, "Population is the
/// scheduler"; `Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift` measured the same
/// construct not converging under a large target). Driving one reconnect —
/// drain grace, kill grace, backoff — takes roughly eight such steps, all
/// inside a single wall-clock budget. So this suite's runtime is set by how
/// many other tests are in flight, which it does not control.
///
/// Measured, and the contrast is the whole argument. Run alone the suite is
/// 16 tests in 11.1 s, and `helloIsWrittenOnConnectAndOnEveryReconnect` — the
/// heaviest, since it drives a full reconnect — takes **0.450 s**. Run inside
/// the 4,600-test fast parallel pass, the same test takes **107.7 s** locally
/// and took **81.1 s** on the one CI run it survived before timing out at
/// **227.4 s** on the runs after. Its fifteen siblings in this same
/// `.serialized` suite stay at 0.03–5.1 s in every one of those configurations,
/// because a serialized suite runs its first test at peak population and the
/// rest in the drained tail. Which side of that a run lands on is a coin flip,
/// not a margin, and raising the budget only moves the coin.
///
/// The time limit is a hang catcher pinned here rather than inherited from
/// `.clockDriven`, whose 240 s is sized for the fast parallel pass (the tier-3
/// convention in `Tests/CLAUDE.md`). It must clear the worst-case failing chain
/// in one test — a 45 s `advanceVirtualTime` budget, a 90 s `waitFor`, and
/// `stopDriven`'s own 45 s, so ~180 s — with room for the run to report.
///
/// `.serialized` because each test spawns children and drives a clock; running
/// them against each other floods the pool with exactly the low-priority work
/// each `checkSuspension` is waiting on (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`, "Clock and date
/// seams").
///
/// Contract under test: `docs/remote-provider-contract.md` § `messages`, and
