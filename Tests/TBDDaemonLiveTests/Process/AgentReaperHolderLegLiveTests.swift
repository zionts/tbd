/// **Tier 3.** Every process here is real: the orphan it reaps, the stranger it
/// must not touch, the pid it is handed after that pid's process is already
/// gone, and the job that refuses SIGTERM and can only be ended by SIGKILL. The
/// identity check is the whole point of the suite — it exists to make sure the
/// leg can tell one from another using `ps`, not using a fake that was told the
/// answer.
///
/// The escalation tests at the bottom are the other half: `reapVerified`'s
/// SIGTERM → grace → re-decide → SIGKILL sequence, driven through the real
/// `ProductionProcessSignaller` against a real session leader whose disposition
/// for SIGTERM is *ignore*. They exist because every other fixture in this file
/// dies on the first SIGTERM, which leaves the highest-consequence branch of a
/// process-killing guard — the group-widening `kill(-pid, SIGKILL)` — proven
/// only by a dictionary swap in the scripted suite.
///
/// The companion `AgentReaperHolderLegTests` in `TBDDaemonTests` scripts the
/// same matrix through `FakeProcessSignaller`; it can state cases this one
/// cannot arrange (an unreadable start time) and runs in the parallel pass.
/// This suite is `.serialized` and lives in the live target because it spawns
/// processes and waits on real deadlines.
