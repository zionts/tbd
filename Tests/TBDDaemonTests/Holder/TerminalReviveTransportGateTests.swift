/// A revive used to be pinned to tmux whatever the flag said. What is pinned
/// here instead is that it decides like every other spawn, and that the
/// decision reaches the *tmux* half of the spawn too: the flag-on failure case
/// asserts no `new-session` was issued, because `prepareTmuxServer` is a no-op
/// for a holder decision and a revive that started a server before failing
/// would leave the very resource the transport exists to remove.
///
/// The failing spawner is a `HolderSpawner` whose executable does not exist:
/// `canSpawn` is decided from the spawner's presence alone, so the gate takes
/// the holder path, and `posix_spawn` then fails before any holder exists.
