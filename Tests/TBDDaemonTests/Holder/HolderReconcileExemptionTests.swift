/// The tmux liveness sweep, and the rows it must not judge on tmux's evidence.
///
/// `reconcileTerminalsWhileLocked` probes `windowExists` for every unparked
/// tmux row and then parks the resumable Claude ones and deletes the rest. A
/// holder-backed session has no tmux coordinate at all — its `tmuxWindowID` is
/// `""`, and the repo's tmux server may never have been started — so that probe
/// can only ever answer "gone". Without the transport fork the sweep destroys a
/// live holder session on the next daemon start, which is precisely the event
/// the holder transport exists to survive.
///
/// A holder row now has an arm of its own, judged on the holder inventory
/// (`HolderReconcileInventoryTests`). This suite pins the half that arm must
/// never reach: a daemon with **no `HolderRegistry`** — mock mode, and every
/// test that does not wire one — knows nothing about holders, and "I cannot
/// ask" must stay distinct from "nobody answered".
///
/// The fork the exemption has to sit ahead of is park-versus-delete: a
/// resumable Claude row is parked and everything else is deleted outright. Both
/// suites here carry one row of each kind, so an exemption placed inside either
/// arm fails the first test, and an exemption that swallowed the whole loop
/// fails the second.
///
/// Both entry points into that loop — the per-repo `reconcile` and
/// `reconcileScratchTerminals` — funnel through the same function, so the
/// behaviour is asserted once, at the loop.
