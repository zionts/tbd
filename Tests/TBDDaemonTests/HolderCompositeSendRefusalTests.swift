/// Until bracketed-paste wrapping lands on the holder arm (PR #816), a
/// multi-line or multi-part message to a holder-backed session is refused BY
/// NAME rather than delivered and silently lost.
///
/// The measurement behind it, against 2.1.261 under a real pty: a single
/// unwrapped write of 63 bytes submits, and a write of 64 bytes or more does not
/// — the tokenizer splits control bytes into key events only while the pending
/// chunk is under 64 bytes, so past that the carriage return is swallowed into
/// the text and the whole string sits unsent in Claude's composer. Several
/// deliveries instead of one would reopen the at-least-once and routing
/// questions that one delivery avoids, so refusing is the honest answer.
