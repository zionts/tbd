/// `ModelProxySupervisor` — adoption, spawning, retirement and routes — with
/// every collaborator it has replaced by something a test can steer.
///
/// Four seams, and each exists because the real thing cannot be *made* to
/// answer the way a branch needs:
///
///   - **the spawner** is a `StubSpawner` that records the ports it was asked
///     for and answers from a queue, including the `ModelProxySpawner.Error`s
///     a real spawn only produces by racing something;
///   - **the proxy** is a `FakeProxyProcess` — a real HTTP listener on a real
///     loopback port — so `ModelProxyClient` is exercised over a socket rather
///     than mocked away. A status document that decodes and a retire that
///     answers are the two facts adoption turns on;
///   - **the process table** is a `StubIdentity` that can admit a pid, deny
///     one, or forget one between polls, which is what a proxy dying looks
///     like from the supervisor's side;
///   - **the clock** is virtual, so the watch interval and the respawn backoff
///     are advanced rather than waited out. Most cases take an
///     `EventDrivenTestClock`, whose arming handshake is a signal rather than
///     a poll; the three that advance a fixed number of times and then assert
///     that nothing further happened keep the fixture's `TestClock`.
///     `SupervisorFixture.supervisor(clock:)` has the split and the reason.
///
/// The rendezvous is not stubbed: `FakeProxyProcess` writes a real
/// `<home>/proxy/proxy.pid` the way the real binary does, and the adoption
/// cases that must be refused corrupt that file rather than a reader — so what
/// the daemon parses is what a proxy would have written.
///
/// Every path is under `TBD_TEST_SCRATCH_ROOT` via `fencedScratchRoot`, and
/// every `TBDConstants` lookup takes an explicit `["TBD_HOME": …]` — no
/// `setenv`, so nothing here needs `TBDHomeSerialized` and nothing can reach
/// the developer's real `~/tbd`.

    /// `checkSuspension()`, whose `megaYield` is 20 serially-awaited
    /// background-QoS tasks; the `advanceUntil` loop this test used ran that
    /// probe every 25 ms, so under the saturated fast pass it flooded the
    /// cooperative pool with exactly the low-priority work the watch task
    /// needed a turn from, and starved the thing it was waiting for. Field
    /// signature: this test reddened on a rerun of an unrelated PR (run
    /// 34279779589 attempt 3) having observed **one** clock advance in 45 s —
    /// the first tick landed and the second re-arm was never seen. Nothing
    /// about the ladder was slow: the fake answers a miss with a prompt 500,
    /// and `ModelProxyClient`'s two-second budget is a `URLSession` deadline
    /// that no test clock touches.
    ///
    /// So each step here advances only once the sleep it is meant to fire is
    /// provably in the ledger, and `EventDrivenTestClock` signals that arming
    /// from inside the critical section that registers the sleeper rather than
    /// racing a probe loop. Strict (`require`) rather than soft, because the
    /// chain is sound only step by step: a missed arming throws before virtual
