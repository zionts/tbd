/// What `terminal.output` owes its readers: **text, with no invisible holes in
/// it.**
///
/// A holder-backed session's screen is the daemon's own headless emulator, and
/// a cell that no program ever wrote holds `CharData.Null` — code 0. Rendering
/// that cell literally puts `U+0000` into the string. Nothing displays it,
/// nothing in a diff shows it, and every consumer that matches on the text —
/// fleet supervision, the hibernation pending-input rail, the interactive
/// login driver — silently fails to find the characters on either side of it.
///
/// The holes are not rare and they are not stationary. A TUI like Claude Code
/// paints differentially: instead of overwriting a run of cells with blanks it
/// *positions the cursor past them* (`\r ESC[82C ESC[1B ● high`,
/// `✻ ESC[3G Cogitated`), so every skipped cell becomes a NUL, and which cells
/// get skipped changes with each repaint — the holes appear to move.
///
/// tmux `capture-pane`, which this render replaces for machine reads, returns
/// spaces. So does the app-side serializer (`TerminalCellWalk`). This suite
/// pins the daemon's renderer to the same projection.
///
/// It exercises the production path rather than a copy of it: `ingest` feeds
/// the reader's emulator synchronously, and `screen` is the very function
/// `terminal.output` calls — `renderScreen` is the viewport-only twin the
/// holder suites read a session's screen with. No drain thread and no real pty
/// are involved, so nothing here is timing-dependent.
