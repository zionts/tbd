/// The forget-tombstone feature: `forget` inserts a `forgotten_worktree` row
/// keyed by path, and reconcile skips tombstoned paths in its re-adopt pass —
/// so forgetting a worktree under a TBD-managed prefix finally sticks.
///
/// Branch coverage for the new gating conditional in reconcile:
///   - tombstone present  → path NOT re-adopted (the bug this feature fixes).
///   - tombstone absent   → path IS adopted (ungated behavior intact).
/// Plus the escape hatch: adopt/create at a tombstoned path clears the
/// tombstone, restoring normal reconcile behavior.
///
/// Uses `createTestRepoResolvingSymlinks` throughout: reconcile compares DB
/// paths against `git worktree list` output, which reports realpath()-resolved
/// paths (/private/var/... on macOS).
