/// Shared helpers for the control-mode test suites (attach orchestration,
/// replay fence, pane repair, input router/health, resize coordinator). All
/// of them fake tmux the same way: a real `TmuxControlCommandClient` whose
/// `writeLine` records stream writes synchronously, with reply blocks fed by
/// hand through `client.handle(...)` — the correlator is exercised, only its
/// stdout is faked.

/// Generous positive-wait poll deadline that only elapses on failure; sized
/// for loaded parallel CI (PR #379: cooperative-pool starvation stretched
/// sub-second async-drain deliveries past a 5 s poll). Passing runs still
/// complete in milliseconds.
///
/// ## This is a hang-catcher, not a timing budget
///
/// "Raise a timeout" reads as a cover-up, so state the case plainly. No test
/// that consumes this value asserts a timing property. They assert that a
/// fake-tmux reply block eventually reaches the stream — the deadline exists
/// only so a reply that never arrives fails with a named diagnostic instead of
/// hanging the run. On success it costs nothing: the poll returns as soon as
/// the condition holds.
///
/// The repo already has the precedent. PR #415 raised `bridge`'s `readyTimeout`
/// from 5 s to an effectively-infinite 600 s for exactly this reason — "the
/// ready-timeout is incidental machinery in every orchestration test here" —
/// and the one test that genuinely exercises the timeout passes its own short
/// value explicitly. That default is still live at
/// `Tests/TBDDaemonTests/AttachRPCTests.swift:137`.
///
/// ## Sizing (30 s -> 90 s)
///
/// 30 s was sized against a ~3000-test population. The population is now 4536
/// and Swift Testing runs all of it in one process with no concurrency cap, so
/// per-test scheduling latency scales with the total, not with this suite. In
/// CI the whole `ControlModeInputHealth` suite has been observed finishing
/// green at 45.8 s / 47.4 s and red at 47.9 s — a ~2 s band on either side of
/// a fixed 30 s wall-clock deadline, which is a coin flip, not a signal. The
/// observed failures burned the *full* 30 s deadline, so the old value was the
/// binding constraint rather than an incidental one.
///
/// 90 s is 3x that deadline, and it is spent against a tail that sharding the
/// fast pass independently roughly halves (p90 26.4 s -> 14.6 s, means over 5
/// iterations, measured interleaved under induced load with population held
/// constant). Two compounding
/// changes, so the effective headroom is well past 3x — and the deadline still
/// elapses only on a genuine hang.
///
/// ## The interaction with `.clockDriven` — read before changing either value
///
/// Two suites that consume this value ARE `.clockDriven`, so its time limit and
/// this deadline race each other: `AttachRPCOrchestrationTests`
/// (`Tests/TBDDaemonTests/AttachRPCTests.swift`, 13 `waitFor` call sites) and
/// `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests` (31 call sites).
///
/// All 44 of those call sites are **unguarded**. They read
/// `try await waitFor(…)`, but `waitFor` is `@discardableResult` and does not
/// throw on timeout — it records an `Issue` and returns `false`, and the `try`
/// covers only the inner `Task.sleep`. Execution therefore continues past a
/// timeout and chained waits are real. (Contrast `ControlModeInputHealthTests`,
/// whose sites are `try #require(await waitFor…)` and so abort at the first
/// timeout.)
///
/// The invariant is **not** "all N chained waits must fit inside the suite
/// limit". That was never satisfiable and is not a property this change gives
/// up: the deepest chain is 6 waits in one `PaneRepairCoordinator` test (the
/// one whose name begins "swallowed successor overflow: gen-2's signal
/// dedup…"), and 6 x 30 s = 180 s already blew the old `.minutes(1)` limit.
///
/// The operative invariant is: **the suite limit must afford the first full
/// deadline plus the rest of an ordinary test.** The first timeout's
/// `Issue.record` fires immediately and carries the named diagnostic, so it
/// always survives even if the limit later truncates the test. Chains beyond
/// the first belong to a test that is already failing; truncating those is
/// acceptable and deliberate.
///
/// Checked against `.clockDriven`'s 4-minute (240 s) limit:
/// - one `waitFor` (90 s) + one `waitForSuspension` (45 s) = 135 s ✓
/// - two `waitFor` = 180 s ✓
/// - two `waitForSuspension` = 90 s ✓ (preserves the "a test that waits twice
///   must afford both waits" property the old pairing reasoned about)
///
/// The margin past that is thin, and the 6-deep chain is not the only case that
/// overruns: counting `waitFor` at 90 s and each clock wait at 45 s, **6 of the
/// 13** `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests` have a worst case above 240 s (the 6-deep
/// one needs 540 s). All of them are consistent with the invariant above — only
/// an already-failing test walks a full chain of timeouts, and the first
/// timeout's diagnostic has already been recorded by then — but none of them
/// has spare room. **If they start tripping, shorten the chains; do not raise
/// 240 s again.** A longer limit only buys time for tests that are already
/// failing, while making every genuine wedge that much slower to attribute.
///
/// ## Why not `@Suite(.serialized)`
///
/// It was considered and it is not the remedy here. `ArchivedWorktreeSearchTests`
/// "Archived search debounce" is *already* `.clockDriven, .serialized` and
/// still failed twice in CI, because the contention is process-global: every
/// target compiles into one process and Swift Testing parallelizes across all
/// of them, so serializing one suite does not reduce the number of runnable
/// tasks its waiter is queued behind. `Tests/CLAUDE.md` advises reaching for
/// `.serialized` before a longer timeout; that advice is about a suite starving
/// *itself* (its own tests megaYielding against each other) and does not cover
/// this case.
///
/// ## The value is shared; this is where its derivation lives
///
/// The number itself is `TestDeadlines.saturatedPass`
/// (`Tests/TestSupport/BoundedGateSupport.swift`), because
/// `Tests/TBDDaemonLiveTests` cannot import this symbol and two waits there
/// need the same budget. Keeping one literal is what stops the three from
/// drifting apart unnoticed; the reasoning above is what re-derives it, and it
/// stays here. Re-derive it together with `TestGate.deadline`, which must
/// dominate it, and with `waitForSuspension` / `.clockDriven`.

/// protocol invariant that exactly one reply block arrives per command, in
/// command order. Production upholds that because `TmuxControlSupervisor.drain`
/// feeds every event from ONE loop — `for await event in connection.events {
/// … await client.handle(event) }` — so blocks reach the actor strictly in
/// stream order.
///
/// A fake `writeLine` that spawns a fresh unstructured `Task { await
/// client.handle(…) }` per write does **not** model that. Those tasks race each
/// other into the actor; their arrival order is a scheduling artifact that
/// matches creation order on an idle box and stops doing so under load. Because
/// `deliverInput` awaits only `sendList` — which returns after the stream
/// **write**, not the reply — several keystrokes are routinely in flight at
/// once, so their verdicts could be permuted onto the wrong commands. With
/// verdicts {fail, ok, ok} arriving as {ok, ok, fail}, the edge-triggered health
/// tracker fires ONE event instead of two and the waiter burns its full
/// `ciSafeDeadline`. That manufactured race — not the router — was the flake.
///
/// `ReplyFeed` restores the production shape. `enqueue` pushes **synchronously**,
/// in write order, into an unbounded `AsyncStream`; one long-lived task awaits
/// `client.handle(...)` for each in turn. Completion order therefore equals

/// `ControlModeInputRouter` itself uses, for the same reason.
///
