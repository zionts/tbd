/// R7-H1: a wedged pty write must not deadlock `stop()`. `sendCommand` holds
/// `ioLock` across a blocking full-write loop; if tmux stops draining the pty
/// the kernel input queue fills (TTYHOG) and the write parks forever holding
/// the lock. `stop()` must make forward progress WITHOUT first acquiring that
/// lock: terminating the child tears the pty down, the blocked write fails
/// with EIO, and only then is the lock needed for fd bookkeeping. Compounded
/// by R6-M4: teardown marks the server `stopping` BEFORE `stop()`, so a
/// deadlocked stop would park every future `ensureConnection` for that server
/// until daemon restart.
///
/// These tests wedge a write for real: a stub "tmux" holds the pty replica
/// open and never reads its stdin, and a 1 MB `sendCommand` from a background
/// thread parks in `write()`. Each stub sleeps a UNIQUE duration so the
/// failure-path `pkill -f` cleanup can target exactly this test's child
/// without touching other suites' stubs.
