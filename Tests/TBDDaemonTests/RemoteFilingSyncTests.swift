/// The filing sync — Task 7 of `docs/plans/2026-08-16-remote-lane-archive.md`,

///
/// Tier 1: in-memory GRDB, a fake provider invoker, and a real actuation log
/// in a temp directory. No subprocesses, no network, no `TBD_HOME`.
///
/// Every timestamp these tests care about is passed in explicitly. Nothing
/// sleeps: the rule under test is an ordering between two `Date`s, so wall
/// time would only make the assertions slower and flakier.
///
/// The time limit is a hang-catcher, not a budget. Three of these tests drive a
/// competing gesture into the sync's check-then-act window, and an earlier
/// rendezvous that blocked a cooperative-pool thread there wedged a CI run for
/// its whole 30-minute step timeout with no failing test and no output. The
/// limit turns any future recurrence into a named red instead. It is the shared
/// dial rather than a number chosen here, because what it has to absorb — the
/// scheduling latency a ~5000-test parallel pass adds to a trivial test — is a
/// property of the pass, not of this suite (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`, "Population is
/// the scheduler"; `.fastPassBounded` in
