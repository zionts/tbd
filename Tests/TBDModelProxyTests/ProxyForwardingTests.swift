/// that stopped. A phase that overruns names itself and fails the test instead.
///
/// `body` runs inside a single "request" phase (60s), sized for an ordinary
/// request/response round trip against `Tests/CLAUDE.md`'s fast-pass-2 numbers
/// (p90 51.4s / max 55.3s reported per-test on a green run). A test whose
/// follow-on work needs its own, differently-sized budget — a bind that races
/// a squatter, a multi-second drain — should not stack that work inside
/// `body`: `withPhaseDeadline` races its operation against a plain
/// `Task.sleep` timer that starts ticking the moment "request" begins, so
/// nested phases *share* that 60s wall-clock window rather than getting one
/// each, and a slow nested phase can trip the generic
/// `ProxyPhaseTimeout("request", 60)` instead of its own named diagnostic
/// (this is exactly what happened to the successor-bind wait in
/// `retireAnswersBeforeDrainAndSuccessorCanBind`). Pass `afterRequest`
/// instead: it runs after `body` returns, with the harness still live and
/// before teardown, but outside "request"'s deadline — so it can size its own
/// phases as siblings, not children, of "request". State `body` opens that
/// `afterRequest` still needs (a still-streaming response body, say) crosses
/// between them the way every other cross-closure value in this file does —
