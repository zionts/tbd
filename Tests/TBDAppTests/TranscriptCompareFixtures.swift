            ## Transcript renderer overview

            The renderer turns a list of **transcript items** into a flat sequence \
            of render nodes. Each node is rendered _once_ and cached, so a re-poll \
            does not rebuild the whole list. Inline code like `transcriptRenderNodes(from:)` \
            is the single entry point.

            For long-form content the body flows as attributed text, while interactive \
            tool calls become embedded cards. See the [design doc](https://example.com/design) \
            for the full rationale and the trade-offs we accepted.

            A third paragraph to exercise vertical spacing and paragraph separation \
            between blocks of prose.

            1. Build the render nodes from items.
            2. Bind the document to the text storage.
            3. Force layout and place attachment views.

            Key points to remember:

            - Cards must not contain a direct `ScrollView`.
            - Hover state is per-row, never list-wide.
            - The badge is inlined, not a sibling node.

            > Note: a flat list under-represents the depth recursion seen in real
            > hover/activation spindumps, so micro-benchmarks are a lower bound.
