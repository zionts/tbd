/// The viewer's half of the handback: closing the descriptor, serializing the
/// screen, and only then telling the daemon.
///
/// **The ordering is the point, and it is asserted as an ordering rather than
/// as two facts.** The daemon puts a drain back on the pty the moment
/// `pane.detach` arrives, so a detach sent before this process was off the fd
/// would mean two readers on one pty — silent byte theft, which nothing
/// reports. Every test here that touches the order therefore observes the
/// descriptor's state *at the instant the detach call is made*, from inside the
/// stub that receives it: the panel is handed one end of a `socketpair`, and the
/// test holds the other, where a `read` returning 0 means every copy of the
/// peer end in this process is closed. A `read` that would block instead means
/// the panel is still on it.

/// Tier 2: a real `TBDTerminalView`, the real reader thread, the real
/// serialization — no daemon, no tmux, no pty.

/// leaves the test parked on its socketpair read rather than failing. It
/// therefore takes the shared dial rather than a number of its own — see
