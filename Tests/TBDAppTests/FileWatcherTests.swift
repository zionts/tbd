/// Tier 2 throughout: a real temp file and a real `DispatchSource` deliver the
/// *event*, so this suite exercises the production kqueue path. What is virtual
/// is the *timer* — `FileWatcher` takes `clock: any Clock<Duration>`, so the
/// 150 ms debounce and the 50 ms re-open delay are asserted at exact virtual
/// boundaries instead of being waited out on a loaded runner.
///
/// Two deliberate splits:
///
/// - The debounce/re-open tests inject a `TestClock` (wrapped, see
///   `RecordingClock`) and never look at wall time for the behaviour under test.
/// - The lifecycle tests construct `FileWatcher()` with **no clock argument**.
///   That is deliberate, but it is *not* proof that the production default is
///   wired: none of them ever writes to the watched file, so none of them
///   reaches `clock.sleep`, and swapping the production default for a
///   `TestClock` would leave all four green.
///   `defaultClockDeliversOneRealDebouncedNotification` is the single test that
///   closes that hole — default clock, a real write, a real ~150 ms wait.
///
/// `.serialized` is load-bearing and now doubly so: `TestClock.advance(to:)`
/// calls `Task.megaYield()` — 20 serially-awaited background-QoS tasks — twice
/// per advance, so clock-driven tests are their own contention source and
/// starve each other when run in parallel. `.clockDriven` is the hang guard for
/// the known virtual-time failure mode (a sleep nobody advances hangs forever).
///
/// ## Deadline budget
///
/// Every wait here is a **hang guard**, never a tolerance window: the healthy
/// path exits on its first probe (whole suite: ~0.6 s locally), and only a
/// genuinely broken watcher pays a deadline. A hang guard being *slow to fire*
/// is the property that distinguishes it from a wall-clock tolerance window,
/// which assertion-hygiene rule 2 forbids. Two tiers:
///
/// | Guard | Value | What it waits on |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `poll` / `writeUntilArmed` default | `TestDeadlines.saturatedPass` | task scheduling, `AsyncStream` delivery, `clock.sleep` entry |
/// | `fdCloseTimeout` | `TestDeadlines.saturatedPass` | `close(fd)` in a GCD **cancel handler on a utility-QoS global queue** |
/// | `withWatchedFile` FD quiescence | `TestDeadlines.saturatedPass` | same cancel handler, but not an assertion |
/// | `advanceWhenSuspended` | 45 s | fixed by `ClockTestSupport`, not ours to set |
/// | `writeUntilArmed`'s `attemptWindow` | 4 s | **not a guard** — the threshold that decides "the event is gone" |
///
/// **The criterion these are sized against** is: the FIRST guard to fire must
/// get its named diagnostic out inside `.clockDriven`'s 240 s per-test limit,
/// otherwise the limit kills the test and reports an unnamed "wedged" instead
/// of observed state (rule 4). Healthy prefix ~0.6 s + the largest single
/// deadline = well under half the limit, for every test here.
///
/// It is deliberately *not* "the sum of every deadline in a test stays under
/// the limit". That framing was unachievable when the limit was 60 s and
/// `ClockTestSupport`'s handshake guard was 15 s used 2–3× per test; it is a
/// weak criterion rather than a wrong one, and it is not what these values are
/// sized against. Several of the deeper tests here — `atomicSaveReopensAndKeepsStreamLive`
/// chains three armed writes, three handshake guards, three polls and an FD
/// wait — have a paper cascade well past 240 s. That is the same arithmetic
/// `.clockDriven`'s own doc comment reports for `PaneRepairCoordinatorTests`,
/// and it is consistent for the same reason: only a test that is *already*
/// failing walks a full chain of timeouts, and its first guard has recorded a
/// named diagnostic before the limit can truncate anything.
///
/// **Why the three guards are one shared constant rather than three derived
/// numbers.** They used to be 8 s, 25 s and 12 s, each fitted to a per-test sum
/// against a 60 s limit. Every one of those was below the fast pass's healthy
/// per-test latency: a hang guard there is not competing with the work it
/// watches but with a scheduler running ~5000 tests on three threads, and a
/// guard that fires on a green run reports a scheduler, not a watcher. The
/// value is therefore `TestDeadlines.saturatedPass`, derived from that pass's
/// measured latency in one place
/// (`Tests/TestSupport/BoundedGateSupport.swift`) and re-derived in one place
/// when the population moves. `attemptWindow` deliberately keeps its own 4 s:
/// it is not a guard but the discriminator between "slow" and "lost", i.e. the
/// assertion itself.
