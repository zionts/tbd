/// Tier 2: drives the two terminal coordinators' real `cleanup()` against a
/// real SwiftTerm `LocalProcess` and a real forked child. No tmux server, no
/// daemon, no `~/tbd` — a bare `Coordinator()` with only `localProcess` set
/// takes every other branch of `cleanup()` as a nil no-op.
///
/// **This is the suite that pins the bug.** `ChildReaperTests` proves the
/// helper reaps, but it would stay green if someone deleted the
/// `ChildReaper.reap` call from `cleanup()`. These two tests reproduce the
/// production sequence end to end — spawn a child that will not exit on its
/// own, tear the coordinator down, and require the child to be gone — so they
/// go red if either half of the fix is removed: the reap call itself, or the
/// `localProcess = nil` that makes `LocalProcess.deinit` (and thus the
/// monitor cancellation and fd close) happen at a known moment.
///
/// **Why `dispatchQueue: .main` and not an injected background queue.**
/// Production passes `dispatchQueue: .main, directDelivery: true` explicitly
/// (since the SwiftTerm 2.0 pin, whose default queue is a private background
/// serial queue, not main), putting `childMonitor` and the `DispatchIO`
/// cleanup handler on main; `startChild` passes the same, because any other
/// queue would test a configuration TBD never uses. That is only sound
/// because this process genuinely drains the main queue (`Tests/CLAUDE.md`),
/// so the monitor is live rather than merely idle — the child outlives the
/// coordinator precisely because `cleanup()` cancels that live monitor,
/// which is the behavior under test.
///
/// **These tests are deliberately NOT `@MainActor`, and each takes exactly one
/// main-actor hop.** They need main only for the steps that are main-isolated
/// — `startProcess` (whose delegate callback asserts main isolation) and
/// `cleanup()` — so each test batches all of those into a single
/// `MainActor.run`, and everything else (every poll, every `waitpid`) happens
/// off it. Both halves were measured under full-suite load: the `@MainActor`
/// version re-acquired main at each of ~200 poll resumptions and blew the 60 s
/// limit on four tests, and a version that merely moved the polls off main but
/// still took four separate hops blew it on two. Main is contended by hundreds
/// of other main-isolated tests in that pass, so the count of hops is the
/// thing to keep small — and never wait for main-queue work while occupying
/// the main queue.
///
/// **How these tests wait: an event, not a window.** `cleanup()` enqueues its
/// reap synchronously onto `ChildReaper`'s concurrent queue, so a barrier
/// submitted after `cleanup()` returns is ordered behind it —
/// `ChildReaper.drainPendingReaps` is that barrier. When it fires, the reap
/// block has *run to completion*, so "the child still exists" means the reap
/// did not reap, full stop. There is no poll anywhere in this suite and
/// therefore no scheduling window to mistake for a bug (nor a bug to mistake
/// for scheduling: a polling test can only report "still there after N tries").
/// The barrier's own cost is bounded by the longest-lived child in the
/// process — see `ChildReaper.drainPendingReaps` for the process-wide caveat.
///
/// **The barrier wait is itself bounded, and by its own guard rather than by
/// the suite limit.** It is ordered behind `waitpid` calls `ChildReaper`
/// documents as unbounded, and neither a parked `waitpid` nor a
/// `withCheckedContinuation` awaiting a callback that never runs can be
/// cancelled by Swift Testing — so an unguarded wait would wedge the run
/// instead of reddening one test, and (a barrier on a concurrent queue blocking
/// everything submitted after it) would take the sibling tests down with it.
/// `drainPendingReaps(within:)` in `ChildReapDrainSupport.swift` races the
/// barrier against a 30 s guard, reports a stuck reap with its observed state,
/// and each call site SIGKILLs and reaps its own child on that path.
///
/// **Why `.fastPassBounded`.** A coarse outer backstop for the ordinary case of
/// a merely slow test — not the guard that catches a stuck reap, which it
/// cannot do (above). What the limit has to afford is a test that fails through
/// the 30 s barrier guard and still gets to report: the guard plus the disposal
/// and assertions that follow it, which is ~35 s of budget. The reason that
/// budget is not simply a written-out minute is that a minute is not a spare
/// four minutes in this pass — it is *below* the median reported duration of a
/// healthy test in it, because reported duration here is mostly time suspended
/// behind ~5000 other runnable tests. So the number is the shared dial and the
/// 30 s guard is checked against it, not against a locally-invented literal.
/// See `.fastPassBounded` in `Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`.
///
/// **Probe children are disposed of before anything can fail.** Assertions run
/// last, after every child this suite spawned has been ended and reaped,
/// because a `defer` registered *after* a throwing `#require` never runs at
/// all — and the probes are `sleep 120` that no production path under test
/// ends. Be precise about what that costs, since the sloppy version of this
/// claim is "they orphan to launchd" and they measurably do not: every child
/// here is on a PTY this process owns, and closing the master fd SIGHUPs it
/// (measured directly — the child goes to `Z` within half a second), so
/// process exit collects them all. What a mis-ordered disposal actually leaves
/// is a live `sleep 120` and an unreaped pid for the *rest of the run*, on
/// every failing iteration, in a process that already runs ~4500 tests. That
/// is worth ordering correctly on its own; it is not the launchd-orphan story.
/// (`cleanup()` also appends a line to `/tmp/tbd-bridge.log` via the
/// production `debugLog`; no TBD-owned store is touched.)

    // MARK: - cleanup() is one-shot
    //
    // The `guard !isTornDown` / `guard !tornDown` guards make `cleanup()`
    // idempotent. **What these tests can and cannot pin, stated plainly:** with
    // the current code a second call is *already* harmless without the guard —
    // the first call nils `localProcess`, so the pid capture yields 0 and
    // `shouldReap` rejects it, and every other branch of `cleanup()` is a nil
    // no-op. A test that merely called `cleanup()` twice would therefore stay
    // green with the guard deleted, i.e. pin nothing at all.
    //
    // So these drive the guard's actual semantics — "once torn down, this
    // coordinator does no further teardown work" — by handing it fresh state
    // and requiring the second call to leave that state completely alone.
    // Production never re-assigns a coordinator after dismantle; the fresh
    // `LocalProcess` is a probe for the guard, not an endorsement of reuse.
    // Deleting either guard reds these: the second `cleanup()` releases the
    // probe, and on the remote path SIGTERMs its child as well.
