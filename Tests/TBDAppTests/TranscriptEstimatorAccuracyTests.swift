/// REGRESSION GUARD on `TableTranscriptView.Coordinator.estimate(for:width:)`.
///
/// `heightOfRow` serves that cheap arithmetic estimate for every row whose exact
/// height is not yet cached, and NSTableView reserves exactly that much space
/// until the row realizes and is corrected to the measured height. A biased
/// estimate is therefore a scroll-position bug in waiting: every correction moves
/// the rows below it, and a systematic bias moves them all the same way. The
/// estimator once over-reserved by 15% on ordinary prose, 31% on a fenced code
/// block and 81% on a GFM table (whose source lines it counted twice), which the
/// reader saw as content sliding upward under the cursor.
///
/// So this file pins two things, and both are contracts rather than incidents:
///
/// 1. the SIGNED error `estimate - exact` for every row kind the pane can show,
///    at both of the column geometries it is laid out at (680 on a host with
///    overlay scrollers, 663 with legacy ones), each against a stated budget;
/// 2. the DIRECTION of whatever error remains — never above the measurement, so
///    the on-realize correction GROWS the row. A row that grows pushes
///    not-yet-read content further down, off screen; a row that shrinks pulls
///    content up into the reading area, which the reader sees as a jump.
///
/// Tier 1: deterministic, in-process, no sleeps, no `~/tbd`.
///
///     scripts/test.sh --filter TranscriptEstimatorAccuracyTests
///
/// ## Why no run loop
/// Everything here is synchronous. The exact heights come from
/// `precomputeBottomWindow()`, which calls the SAME private `measuredHeight` that
/// `viewFor` calls when a row realizes, and caches it under the same
/// `(id, contentVersion, width)` key — so `cachedExactHeight(for:)` after a
/// precompute IS the realized height. `realizeAllRows` is run afterwards purely
/// to prove that: it must not change a single cached height. That avoids
/// `RunLoop.current.run(until:)`, which inside a `@MainActor` test resumes every
/// other suspended `@MainActor` test in the process inside this test's body.
///
/// ## Why the width is pinned by hand
/// The scroll view's settled column width depends on the host's scroller style
/// and on whether the document has outgrown the viewport yet. This file needs two
/// EXACT widths, so it lays the scroll view out once at the target and then pins
/// the table's own frame and column to it, asserting the coordinator's effective
/// width before any number is recorded. The `scrollerStyle = .legacy` pin from the
/// sibling harness is kept.
