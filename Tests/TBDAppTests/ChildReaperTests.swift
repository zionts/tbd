/// Tier 2: real forked children, but no external server and no wall-clock
/// assertion — `reapBlocking` is deterministic by construction, and the two
/// bounded polls here observe children that have already been asked to exit.
/// It lives in `TBDAppTests` rather than the tier-3 target because
/// `Tests/TBDDaemonLiveTests` does not link `TBDApp`.
///
/// What these pin: the reaper actually reaps. SwiftTerm's `LocalProcess`
/// cancels its own exit monitor before the child exits, so `waitpid` never
/// runs and every torn-down terminal leaves a permanent `<defunct>` child under
/// TBDApp. `ChildReaper` is the guaranteed `waitpid`; a non-blocking (`WNOHANG`)
/// or event-source implementation fails `reapsAChildThatIsStillRunning` below.
///
/// HOW THESE TESTS WAIT. The background-reap tests await an **event**, not a
/// window: `ChildReaper.drainPendingReaps` puts a barrier on the reaper's own
/// concurrent queue, so when it fires every reap already enqueued has *run to
/// completion*. A child that still exists after that is a reap that did not
/// reap — a contract failure, not a scheduling delay. The single remaining
/// bounded poll, `waitUntilZombie`, waits for a child to **exit**, which is not
/// an in-process event and therefore has nothing to be ordered behind; it is
/// documented as a hang guard at its definition.
///
/// Both waits carry their own bounded hang guard, and that is deliberate:
/// **neither one can be rescued by the suite `.timeLimit`.** Swift Testing
/// cannot cancel a thread parked in a synchronous `waitpid`, nor a
/// `withCheckedContinuation` awaiting a barrier callback that never runs — a
/// child that ignored its signals would wedge the whole run rather than redden
/// one test. `drainPendingReaps(within:)` (see `ChildReapDrainSupport.swift`)
/// and `waitUntilZombie` each convert that into a named failure, and each
/// disposes of its child on that path so a stuck reap cannot poison the tests
/// that follow.
///
/// WHY `.fastPassBounded` AND NOT A NUMBER OF ITS OWN. What the limit has to
/// afford is a test that fails through its own guards and still gets to report:
/// the 30 s barrier hang guard plus the ~5 s `waitUntilZombie` budget plus the
/// disposal that follows — 35 s, so the diagnostic lands rather than being
/// truncated. The honest path meanwhile finishes in under a second (the
/// longest-lived child in the process is 0.3 s). This suite arms no `TestClock`,
/// which is why the trait is not spelled `.clockDriven`; but the two are one
/// value, because what sizes them is the fast parallel pass rather than virtual
/// time. The sixty seconds this used to spell out was reasoned as "four minutes
/// of a shared box is not free", and that reasoning was wrong in its premise: a
/// suite limit is wall time only on a failing run, and one minute is *below*
/// the median reported duration of a healthy test in this pass, where duration
/// is mostly suspension behind ~5000 other runnable tests. See
/// `.fastPassBounded` in `Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`.
///
/// What the limit therefore is, stated rather than glossed: a coarse outer
/// backstop for the ordinary case where a test is merely slow. The two waits
/// above are what actually catch a stuck reap, and both are sized to fire —
/// with their diagnostic — inside this limit rather than be truncated by it.
