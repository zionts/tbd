/// How long a barrier wait may take before it is reported as a stuck reap.
///
/// The honest cost of the barrier is the longest-lived child in the process:
/// every child these suites spawn is either `/bin/sleep 0`–`0.4` or a `sleep
/// 120` that teardown SIGTERMs, so a healthy drain returns in well under a
/// second. 30 s is ~30x that. It must also land inside the two suites' shared
/// suite limit with room for the disposal and assertions that follow it, so
/// that a stuck reap is reported by *this* guard, with its observed state,
/// rather than truncated into a bare "Time limit was exceeded". That limit is
/// `.fastPassBounded` (`Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`) — 240 s, one
/// dial derived from the fast pass's measured latency — which leaves this
/// guard 8x of room instead of the 2x the hand-written one minute left it. It
/// is a hang guard, not a timing assertion: a passing run never spends any
/// of it.

/// Suspends until every reap `ChildReaper` had already enqueued has run to
/// completion — or until `budget` elapses, or the task is cancelled.
///
/// **The fast path is the point, and it is an event, not a window.**
/// `ChildReaper.drainPendingReaps` puts a barrier on the reaper's own concurrent
/// queue, so when it fires every reap enqueued before this call has *finished*.
/// A child that still exists after that is a contract failure, not a scheduling
/// delay — which is the distinction polling cannot make (it can only ever report
/// "still there after N tries"). Suspending rather than blocking also keeps the
/// main queue draining, which the teardown suite needs.
///
/// **Why the wait is nevertheless bounded.** The barrier is ordered behind
/// `waitpid` calls that `ChildReaper` itself documents as unbounded: a child
/// that ignores `SIGHUP` never exits and its reaper thread parks forever. No
/// suite `.timeLimit` can rescue that — a `withCheckedContinuation` awaiting a
/// callback that never runs is not cancellable, and Swift Testing cannot cancel
/// a thread parked in a synchronous `waitpid` either — so an unbounded barrier
/// wait would wedge the whole run instead of reddening one test. The hang guard
/// converts that back into a red test with a named diagnostic, and the caller
/// SIGKILLs its own child on that path so the stall cannot poison siblings.
///
/// **Two properties of the barrier the caller has to know.** It is *process-
/// wide*, so it also waits on reaps enqueued by any concurrently running test.
/// And a barrier on a *concurrent* queue also blocks every block submitted
/// after it, which is precisely the serialization
/// `ChildReaper.queue`'s `.concurrent` attribute exists to avoid: while one reap
/// is parked, later reaps still run (they were submitted before this barrier),
/// but every *subsequent* barrier queues behind this one. So a single stuck reap
/// costs each later test one bounded `budget` and a named failure — degraded,
/// attributable, and finite — instead of a wedge.
///
/// The guard task is cancelled on the fast path, and cancellation of the caller
/// resolves the wait immediately rather than waiting the budget out.
