/// A SwiftUI view mounted in a real — but offscreen — AppKit window, for the
/// questions no pure function can answer: where a view actually landed, what an

/// like once it is drawn.
///
/// ## What hosting offscreen proves
///
/// - **Real layout.** Frames come from AppKit's own layout pass, in window
///   coordinates, so a test can assert that one view sits above another rather
///   than that a modifier was written.
/// - **Real SwiftUI lifecycle** — but only because the window is *shown*.
///   SwiftUI lays out a hierarchy and runs its `.task` only for a view in a
///   window that has been ordered front, so the window is; it sits at
///   `offscreenOrigin`, far off every display, and is never made key, so
///   showing it takes no focus from whoever is running the suite.
/// - **Both pumps.** `pump()` turns the main run loop, which drives AppKit's
///   layout and display, *and* yields to the cooperative pool, which drives
///   `.task`. Waiting on only one of the two waits forever.
/// - **A real accessibility tree**, inside `withAccessibilityBridge` — see
///   `accessibilityIdentifiers()`, and `AccessibilityBridgeSerialized` for why
///   that switch is scoped rather than simply set.
/// - **A real drawn frame**, via `capture()`.
///
/// ## What it does not prove
///
/// - **AppKit-versus-SwiftUI compositing does not reproduce offscreen.** In an
///   offscreen `cacheDisplay` of an `NSHostingView`, SwiftUI already orders its
///   own overlay above a representable sibling declared before it, whether or
///   not production states that order with `.zIndex`. Measured in
///   `CompletionOverlayPlacementTests.theListPaintsOverTheAppKitViewBesideIt`,
///   which comes back pixel-for-pixel identical with the modifier removed. A
///   capture is a guard on the outcome, never a test that discriminates a
///   stacking modifier.
/// - **Nothing about events.** The window is never key, there is no first
///   responder, and no hit testing happens. A control's *reachability* is an
///   accessibility question, which this host can ask; a control's *response to
///   a click* is not.
/// - **Nothing about elapsed time.** `settle` is bounded by a pump count, never
///   by wall clock, so behavior that genuinely needs real seconds to pass — an
///   animation running to completion, a debounce on a real clock — does not
///   finish here. Inject a clock and test that without a window.
/// - **Nothing about the display.** The window is on no screen: the backing
///   scale is 1 unless `capture(scale:)` asks for another, and vibrancy and font
///   smoothing resolve without a real display's colour space, which is why
///   colour assertions compare against a pixel read back from the same capture
///   rather than against a literal.
