/// Tier 2: the two teardown paths that must reclaim a tmux **view session**,
/// driven against a recording command runner instead of a tmux server.
///
/// Every viewed panel gets its own `tbd-view-<panel prefix>` session with the
/// worktree's window linked into it, and tmux destroys a window only when the
/// last session referencing it goes away — so a view session nobody kills
/// keeps that window, its pane process and the whole tmux server alive after
/// the owning `main` session is gone. `TmuxBridge` also kills the view
/// session's own initial window, so a leaked one holds nothing *but* linked
/// worktree windows.
///
/// The two paths, and why each has a test:
///
/// - **Coordinator release.** `cleanup()` runs only from `dismantleNSView`,
///   which SwiftUI does not guarantee to run; the bridge log recorded 15
///   `PANEL: deinit` lines in 35 seconds with no matching `PANEL: cleanup`.
///   `deinit` therefore reclaims the session itself, relying on
///   `cleanupSession`'s idempotence so a normal dismantle still kills once.
/// - **App termination.** `applicationWillTerminate` has to *block* on the
///   kills; a detached task does not outlive the process.
/// - **A preparation that lands after teardown.** `prepareSession` registers
///   the session with the bridge before its caller records the generation, so
///   a teardown that lands inside that window leaves an entry neither
///   `cleanup()` nor `deinit` can name. The preparation reclaims it itself.
///
/// Both per-panel paths are scoped to the generation their own
/// `prepareSession` minted, because `panelID` alone does not identify a
/// preparation — see `supersededCoordinatorReleaseSparesTheRebuiltViewSession`.
/// The termination path deliberately is not: it reclaims everything tracked.
///
/// **Every test that touches a `Coordinator` is `@MainActor`.** `Coordinator`
/// conforms to SwiftTerm's `TerminalViewDelegate`, which is `@MainActor` on
/// the pinned fork, so the class inherits that isolation — its `init`,
/// `tmuxBridge`, `tmuxServer`, `panelID` and `viewSessionReclaim` are all
/// main-isolated and cannot be reached from a non-isolated test body. The
/// releases those tests drive therefore run on the main thread, which is where
/// SwiftUI drops coordinators in production anyway; `deinit` stays
/// non-isolated and still reads its facts through `ViewSessionReclaim`, which
/// is the property `publishedPreparationIsReadableOffTheMainThread` pins —
/// that test constructs no `Coordinator`, so it stays off the main actor and
/// does its read from a global queue.
///
/// The annotation costs one main-actor hop per `await`, not one per poll:
/// every bounded wait here is a method on the `RecordingTmuxRunner` actor, so
/// the polling loop runs on that actor's executor and the test body resumes
/// exactly once. (`TerminalTeardownReapTests` batches its hops by hand for the
/// opposite reason — its waits resume on the caller.)
