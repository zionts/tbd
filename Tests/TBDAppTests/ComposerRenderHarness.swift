/// Env-gated **render** harness for the transcript composer: one PNG per state
/// it can be in, at 2x, for a person to look at.
///
/// Its subject is the half of a UI that assertions are bad at. Every other
/// composer suite asks a question with a right answer — does the list open
/// upward, is the send button reachable — and none of them can tell you that the
/// blocked banner's icon collides with its message, or that the attachment
/// thumbnail sits a hair below the text baseline. A render can, and the last one
/// of these caught exactly that class of defect (#829, the completion list
/// covering the words being typed) before it shipped.
///
/// Inert during a normal run: every test early-returns unless
/// `TBD_COMPOSER_SHOTS_DIR` names a directory to write into.
///
///     TBD_COMPOSER_SHOTS_DIR=/tmp/composer-shots scripts/test.sh \
///         --filter ComposerRenderHarness
///
/// **Each shot asserts it is not blank.** A view that was never laid out renders
/// as a large, perfectly plausible white rectangle, and a harness that wrote one
/// out would report success and hand over a picture of nothing. The luminance
/// variance of the capture has to clear `OffscreenHostDefaults.minLuminanceVariance`
/// before the file is written, so a broken render fails instead of landing a
/// blank PNG beside the real ones.
