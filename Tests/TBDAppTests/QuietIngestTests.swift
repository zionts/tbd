/// A snapshot preamble is *replayed history*, but its bytes look live to the
/// emulator. This suite drives `Coordinator.feedSnapshot` on the production
/// wiring — a real `TBDTerminalView` whose `terminalDelegate` is a real
/// `Coordinator`, exactly as `makeNSView` wires one — and asserts on **what did
/// not happen**: no bytes reached the child, no interrupt was raised, no ring,
/// no pasteboard write, no `TIOCSWINSZ`, no notification.
///
/// Every one of those is an assertion about an absence, so every test carries a
/// positive control on the same path: the same bytes fed **live** must produce
/// the effect the ingest arm requires to be missing. Without that control a
/// broken fixture — an escape sequence this emulator ignores, a probe wired to
/// nothing — reads as a pass.
///
/// **The child is real.** `send`'s only observable effect on the local-PTY
/// route is a write to `localProcess`'s descriptor, and `LocalProcess.send`
/// drops everything unless a process is actually running — so a coordinator
/// with no child would report "no bytes escaped" for the wrong reason. The
/// harness therefore starts one (`/bin/sleep 120`, killed at teardown) and reads
/// the tty's own echo back through the `LocalProcessDelegate`. That descriptor
/// is also the witness for the resize guard.
///
/// **Timing is the subtle part.** SwiftTerm hops every `TerminalViewDelegate`
/// callback through `TerminalView.onMain`, an unconditional
/// `DispatchQueue.main.async` even when the parse already runs on main. So a
/// reply provoked by `feed` is not delivered inside `feed` — it is queued
/// behind it. That is why `feedSnapshot` lowers its flag from a main-queue
/// block rather than on return, and why every assertion here runs after
/// `settle()`.
///
/// Nothing here talks to a live daemon: the interrupt path's best-effort
/// `setTerminalActivity` RPC goes to `TBD_SOCKET_PATH`, which `scripts/test.sh`
/// fences onto a scratch path with no listener.
///
/// The suite limit is a hang guard — every wait here is bounded on its own, and
/// the limit exists so a `settle()` that never settles is a named red rather
/// than a silent stall. It takes the shared dial rather than a number of its
/// own: see `.fastPassBounded` in `Tests/TestSupport/ClockTestSupport.swift`.
