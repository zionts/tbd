/// Two properties, both structural. **The whitelist is enforced at
/// construction**, so a row carrying a control character cannot be shipped to a
/// consumer that matches on text and would silently fail to find the characters
/// on either side of it — the failure mode measured in the field as 1,595
/// invisible `U+0000` cells nobody had noticed. And **`output` is derived**, so
/// it can never disagree with `lines` however it arrived — including on the
/// wire, where the screen carries only `lines` and the joined string a script
/// reads sits at the top level of `TerminalOutputResult`.
///
/// The NUL-to-space projection itself is deliberately *not* here. It belongs to
/// whichever store rendered the grid, and is pinned on the constructed value in
/// `HolderScreenContractTests`; here a NUL is simply refused like any other
/// control character, which is what makes a projection that forgot it loud.
